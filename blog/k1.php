  <h2>3 Crucial Life Lessons I have Learnt During This Lockdown</h2>
  <p>If life is the greatest teacher, then during these times I have earned my masters degree. Sometimes I feel like I am watching a movie.Life seems like a satire or dark comedy these days and I was never a fan of both the genre. No, wait, that’s not completely true – I loveee fight club.But the point I am trying to make here is that during the past few weeks, I have managed to hold on to my sanity (it’s surprising, even for me), upgrade my fitness levels by working out 4 times a week ( home workouts and POPSUGAR fitness came to the rescue) and eating the healthiest shit I can lay my hands on. And not to brag, my cooking skills have gotten really good.But most importantly, I have had the time to introspect and journal a lot and here’s what I have discovered.

    <h4>I have Learnt During This Lockdown</h4>
    <p>Besides supplying good amounts of protein, phosphorus, and zinc, beet greens are also a great source of fiber. Packed with antioxidants, they’re high in vitamin B6, magnesium, potassium, copper, and manganese, and low in fat and cholesterol. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet, daily values of beet greens contain: 220% of vitamin A, 60% of vitamin C, 16% of calcium, and 15% of iron.

As if that weren’t enough, studies have also shown that the vitamin K in beet greens contains blood clotting properties, helps ward off osteoporosis, works with calcium to boost bone strength, and may also play a role in fighting Alzheimer’s disease. Beet greens have a higher iron content than spinach, and a higher nutritional value than the beetroot itself.

The vitamin A content in beet greens helps strengthen the immune system and stimulates production of antibodies and white blood cells. The beta-carotene in vitamin A is a known antioxidant that can fight the effects of free radicals in the body along with cancer and heart disease. Doctors often recommend vitamin A to patients at risk of developing night blindness.</p>
