  <h2>Baked Potato Wedges</h2>
  <p>These ultra crispy baked potato wedges are coated in seasonings and cooked in the oven to golden brown perfection. These baked fries are the perfect side dish for almost any meal, they’re just as flavorful as the deep fried variety but with way less calories!You can never go wrong with potatoes, whether it’s a cheesy casserole, buttery mashed potatoes, or these simple yet satisfying potato wedges.
  Who loves french fries? I sure do, and my kids also love ’em. I don’t do a lot of frying in my home kitchen, so I sought out to come up with the ultimate baked french fry. These baked potato wedges are coated in spices and parmesan cheese, then oven roasted until they’re crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. In my opinion they’re just as delicious as deep fried potatoes!<br>
  The first step is to scrub your potatoes until clean, then slice each potato in half lengthwise. Cut each half in half again lengthwise to make quarters, then slice those quarters into eights for the perfect wedges.<br>After you’ve sliced all of your potatoes, it’s time to coat them with flavor. I use a blend of olive oil, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder and onion powder. You can either place the oil and seasonings with your potatoes in a bowl and toss them until coated, or you can put everything into a resealable gallon sized bag and shake to coat. The next step is bake your potatoes at a high temperature until browned and crispy. Add a sprinkling of parsley, then you’ll be ready to eat!
