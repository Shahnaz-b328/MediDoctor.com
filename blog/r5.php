  <h2>Fried Tempura Prawns</h2>
  <p>Tempura is a popular Japanese dish of vegetables and seafood coated in a very light and airy batter and fried to perfection. It's served at Japanese restaurants worldwide, but it's also fun and easy to make from scratch at home. This is a quick recipe that's best when fried as soon as the batter is mixed and then eaten right away. Plan and prepare your dinner before you begin.

  A basic Japanese tempura batter is made of flour, egg, and ice water. While simple, there are some tricks to producing crispy tempura. Ice water, sifted flour, and hot oil are just a few of the key factors that will produce restaurant-style results.

  Nearly anything you can deep-fry is a candidate for tempura batter. Shrimp tempura is the best known, and chicken tenders or fish fillets work, too. For vegetables, try bell peppers, broccoli, eggplant, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes. The batter can even be used to make onion rings. Serve the tempura with your favorite dipping sauces and enjoy as an appetizer or light meal.
