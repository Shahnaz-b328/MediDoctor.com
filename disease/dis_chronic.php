  <h2>What causes Anaphylaxis?</h2>
  <p>A common scenario can help explain how allergies develop. A few 
  	months after the new cat arrives in the house, dad begins to have 
  	itchy eyes and episodes of sneezing. One of the three children 
  	develops coughing and wheezing. The mom and the other two children
  	 experience no reaction despite the presence of the cat. How can this
  	  occur?

The immune system is the body's organized defense mechanism against foreign
 invaders, particularly infections. Its job is to recognize and react to 
 these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead 
 to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are
  protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular
   antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA),
    are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to
     its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to 
     destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of 
     antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain 
     normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or 
     foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production
      of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is 
      formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic
       response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and 
       Teriko Ishizaka.

    <h4>Health Benefits of Acai Berry</h4>
    <p>This little berry's list of attributes includes a high level of antioxidant activity similar to cranberries, but more than what's been found in blueberries and strawberries. Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) values measuring the antioxidant power of acai fruit pulp/skin powder reportedly have the highest ORAC value among fruits and vegetables, or 10 times more antioxidants than red grapes.

Acai berries are low in sugar, but contain excellent amounts of calcium, fiber, and vitamin A. They also contain anthocyanin compounds such as resveratrol and cyaniding and ferulic acid, which not only give fruits and vegetables their distinct color, but also team up with flavonoids to defend the body against harmful free radicals. In fact, acai berries contain 10 to 30 times more anthocyanin power than red wine. Beneficial fatty acids such as oleic acid, one of the same oils found in olive oil, is another strong point, and healthy levels of dietary fiber keep the system functioning smoothly.

The properties contained in acai berries may help prevent health problems such as arthritis, inflammation, obesity, erectile dysfunction, neurological diseases, and allergies. Lab studies have shown them to have positive effects on ailments associated with oxidative stress, heart disease, and cancer.

Acai berries should be consumed in moderation, because they still contain sugar, even if in lower levels than other fruits. Remember, fructose may be harmful to your health in excessive amounts.</p>

    <h4>Studies Done on Acai</h4>
    <p>A study published in mid-2011 reported that the aca√≠ berry not only offers potential health benefits due to its antioxidant scavenging capacities, but also suppresses biological activity that would degrade cellular integrity.1

Research published in September 2012 reported the effects of acai berry pulp on chemically-induced urothelial bladder cancer in mice, and the incidence and multiplicity of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). After 10 weeks of treatment, the acai berry pulp treatment was found to reduce the TCC incidence, multiplicity, and tumor cell proliferation, as well as significantly reduce DNA damage. The study authors reported that the positive acai berry pulp treatment was probably due to the fruit's antioxidant abilities.2

The purpose of another study was to evaluate how acai fruit pulp affected metabolic disorder risks. It involved 10 overweight adults taking 100 grams of acai pulp twice daily for a month. Prior to the study, each subject's blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other biomarkers were measured.

At the end of the 30-day trial, researchers found reductions in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and total cholesterol; however, there was no effect on blood pressure. Scientists concluded that the acai fruit pulp reduced the levels of selected metabolic disease markers in the overweight subjects, indicating that further studies, including those on heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes, are warranted.3</p>
