  <h2>What Is Coffee Bean Good For?</h2>
  <p>According to the National Coffee Association of U.S.A., 62 percent of Americans drank coffee on a daily basis in 2017.1 With the sheer number of coffee consumers, almost everyone knows what a whole roasted coffee bean looks like and how aromatic it can be when roasted and perfectly brewed.

But have you ever wondered what a coffee bean looks like when it’s raw, or how it’s harvested from the coffee plant? Read on to learn more about coffee beans, their different types, health benefits and the proper ways to roast them at home.</p>


    <h4>What Is a Coffee Bean?</h4>
    <p>A coffee “bean” is actually the seed of a cherry-like fruit that grows on a genus of plant known as Coffea. There are approximately 25 to 100 species of coffee plant under this genus, some of which grow as small shrubs while others grow as tall as trees. The most important species of coffee plant that are cultivated for drinking are the Arabica and Robusta.2

It usually takes three to four years before coffee plants bear fruit. Once the fruit’s color is a deep shade of red, they’re harvested and processed in order to obtain the seeds inside. The coffee beans are then hulled, polished, graded and sorted before being exported.3

The milled coffee beans are called “green beans.” They can be brewed to make green coffee, which is believed to have weight loss properties due to its chlorogenic acid content.4 Green coffee beans can also be slightly roasted to make “white” coffee beans (which are actually tan in color).

White coffee beans are considered specialty items and are not widely available. They have a nutty taste when brewed, and are usually mixed with other ingredients to make a gourmet drink.5 Other levels of coffee bean roast include:6,7

Light roasts: Lightly roasted coffee beans give off a delicate flavor when brewed. They’re more acidic than other types of roasts. Their surface also looks dry, since they haven’t been roasted long enough to extract their oils. This degree of roasting is commonly used for high-quality beans to make their original taste more noticeable than the roasted flavor.
Medium roasts: Usually referred to as “American roast,” medium-roasted coffee beans are medium-brown in color, with a slightly toastier flavor and less acidity than lightly roasted beans. Most people prefer this type because of its balanced flavor and acidity.
Dark roasts: Dark-roasted coffee beans are characterized by their very low acidity, shiny black surface and strong, smoky taste. Low-quality beans are often used for this type of roast in order to overpower their original taste with a toasty flavor.</p>

    <h4>Types of Coffee Beans</h4>
    <p>The shape, size, color and flavor of coffee beans vary according to their type. Most of coffee beans available today fall into these two varieties:8,9,10

Arabica (C. Arabica): Coffee Arabica is grown at high altitudes, generally between 2,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level with temperatures of 59 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 60 inches of annual rainfall. The beans of this coffee plant are flat and elongated, and contain lower amounts of caffeine than Robusta beans, which is why they have a delicate flavor and low acidity.
Arabica trees are costly to grow because of their terrain and climate requirements. They’re also labor-intensive to cultivate, as they’re more prone to diseases and pests. Because of their delicate characteristics, Arabica coffee beans are sold at a higher price.

Robusta (C. canephora var. Robusta): Robusta coffee beans are grown at lower altitudes, with a constant temperature of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Its terrain and climate requirements make it easier to cultivate than Arabica, hence why it’s sold at a cheaper price and commonly used in instant coffee blends.
Robusta coffee beans contain higher levels of caffeine, which account for its harsh and bitter flavor. Although it’s usually considered inferior to Arabica, Robusta coffee beans are valued in espressos because of their rich and deep flavor.

The third most relevant coffee plant species that’s cultivated for consumption is Coffea liberica, which grows best in hot climates and low elevations. It’s not as widely available as other types of coffee beans, since it only accounts for less than 1 percent of the world’s coffee production. Meanwhile, Arabica and Robusta represent approximately 60 and 40 percent of world’s coffee production, respectively.11
