  <h2>What Is Breadfruit Good For?</h2>
  <p>Cultivated for over 3,000 years, breadfruit is a crop native to Papua New Guinea1 and widely consumed throughout the Pacific islands. It’s also grown in other tropical parts of the world, such as the Caribbean, India and Africa,2 to name a few, and possesses a very distinct texture and taste.

While it may not be your first fruit of choice in terms of flavor profile, many experts believe that it may help provide food security in poverty-stricken parts of the world because of its abundant yield.3 Read on to learn more about the uses and benefits of this unusual fruit, and how you can incorporate it into your meals.

    <h4>Breadfruit Benefits That You Can Take Advantage Of</h4>
    <p>Breadfruit is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber.9 A study published in the journal Amino Acid also deemed it a good source of high-quality protein, as it’s found to contain higher amounts of essential amino acids, particularly phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine and valine.10

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database, a cup of raw breadfruit contains a variety of beneficial vitamins and minerals, including calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin B complex, among others.11 Due to its wide array of nutrients, breadfruit may deliver the following health benefits:12
 

Helps inhibit the negative effects of free radicals: According to the journal Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, breadfruit contains phenolic compounds and flavonoids that have antioxidant properties — this makes it useful for fighting against oxidative stress caused by free radicals.13
Helps improve heart health: Breadfruit is found to have phytochemicals that may help prevent atherosclerosis,14 a condition where the arteries harden and narrow due to fatty deposits.15 Its extract may also help inhibit high cholesterol levels, which can make you more susceptible to heart disease.16
Helps reduce your risk for certain types of cancer: According to the journal Planta Medica, the chemical compounds of breadfruit exhibit cytotoxic properties against pancreatic cancer cells.17 A separate study published in the Phytotherapy Research journal also supports the cancer-fighting properties of this fruit, stating that it helped inhibit the growth of prostate tumors and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.</p>

    <h4>Breadfruit Nutrition Facts</h4>
    <p>A study published in mid-2011 reported that the acaí berry not only offers potential health benefits due to its antioxidant scavenging capacities, but also suppresses biological activity that would degrade cellular integrity.1

Research published in September 2012 reported the effects of acai berry pulp on chemically-induced urothelial bladder cancer in mice, and the incidence and multiplicity of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). After 10 weeks of treatment, the acai berry pulp treatment was found to reduce the TCC incidence, multiplicity, and tumor cell proliferation, as well as significantly reduce DNA damage. The study authors reported that the positive acai berry pulp treatment was probably due to the fruit's antioxidant abilities.2

The purpose of another study was to evaluate how acai fruit pulp affected metabolic disorder risks. It involved 10 overweight adults taking 100 grams of acai pulp twice daily for a month. Prior to the study, each subject's blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other biomarkers were measured.

At the end of the 30-day trial, researchers found reductions in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and total cholesterol; however, there was no effect on blood pressure. Scientists concluded that the acai fruit pulp reduced the levels of selected metabolic disease markers in the overweight subjects, indicating that further studies, including those on heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes, are warranted.3</p>
