  <h2>What Are Citrons Good For?</h2>
  <p>Citron (Citrus medica) is a citrus fruit many people might recognize from the fruit preserves they add to their pastry or granola recipes. While not as popular as its other citrus relatives, Citron certainly doesn’t fall short when it comes to the nutrients it contains and the uses it has.
	</p>

    <h4>What Benefits Can You Get From Citron?</h4>
    <p>While citron may look like a bumpy and unattractive lemon, the vitamins and nutrients it offers are surely striking. Citrons are loaded with properties that can boost your immune system, balance acid levels in the gut and improve digestion. Some of the benefits you can get from citrons include: 9

	Helps regulate blood pressure. Citron is rich in potassium and vitamin C, two compounds that help regulate blood circulation by reducing the strain on blood vessels.10
	Helps protect you from oxidative stress. The high antioxidant and vitamin C content in citron may help protect you from free radicals that can cause a barrage of chronic diseases.
	Works as an analgesic. A 2010 study shows that citron may be used to relieve pain because of its flavonoid and phenolic components.11
	May help fight against infections. A 2012 study shows that the peel extract of citron is an effective antibacterial and antiviral agent. It has potential in fighting off staph, E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</p>

    <h4>Studies Done on Citron</h4>
    <p>A study published in mid-2011 reported that the acaí berry not only offers potential health benefits due to its antioxidant scavenging capacities, but also suppresses biological activity that would degrade cellular integrity.1

Research published in September 2012 reported the effects of acai berry pulp on chemically-induced urothelial bladder cancer in mice, and the incidence and multiplicity of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). After 10 weeks of treatment, the acai berry pulp treatment was found to reduce the TCC incidence, multiplicity, and tumor cell proliferation, as well as significantly reduce DNA damage. The study authors reported that the positive acai berry pulp treatment was probably due to the fruit's antioxidant abilities.2

The purpose of another study was to evaluate how acai fruit pulp affected metabolic disorder risks. It involved 10 overweight adults taking 100 grams of acai pulp twice daily for a month. Prior to the study, each subject's blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other biomarkers were measured.

At the end of the 30-day trial, researchers found reductions in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and total cholesterol; however, there was no effect on blood pressure. Scientists concluded that the acai fruit pulp reduced the levels of selected metabolic disease markers in the overweight subjects, indicating that further studies, including those on heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes, are warranted.3</p>
