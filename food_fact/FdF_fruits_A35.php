  <h2>What are limes good for?</h2>
  <p>Wonderful for bringing out the flavor of other foods, limes have their own distinctive citrus flavor, despite being similar to lemons.

Limes’ origins can be traced to Asia, particularly to Northeast India and Indochina,1 and eventually reached African and eastern Mediterranean countries through Arab traders. They spread to western Mediterranean countries during the 12th and 13th centuries after the Crusades.2

Christopher Columbus is believed to have brought the fruit to Haiti. From that point, Spanish missionaries brought them to Florida.3 Limes have been used to prevent scurvy, a disease that can lead to shortness of breath, pain and tooth loss.4,5

They’re also typically added to various desserts and beverages,6 and are widely grown in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Pakistan and India, and in the Middle East.7

Growers usually cultivate key, Tahitian (Persian) or makrut (kaffir) limes for commercial purposes. Out of these three types, the Tahitian lime is the most popular and is grown worldwide. This medium-sized, oval-shaped lime is said to have a “‘true’ lime flavor.”8

Meanwhile, key limes, which are popular because they’re used to make the famous pie of the same name, are smaller9 and more acidic.10 No matter which variety you prefer, make sure that when picking or purchasing limes, they're a deep, dark green color and are close to ripe.</p>


    <h4>Health benefits of limes</h4>
    <p>Limes contain powerful compounds like alkaloids, carotenoids, coumarins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, triterpenoids, kaempferol, apigenin, hesperetin and quercetin, to name a few.12

Limes’ vitamin C content is notable too. It was proven to aid in lowering your risk of being affected with cold and flu symptoms13 and addressing pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis.14 Eating foods containing significant amounts of vitamin C, like limes, may also help lower the risk of other health problems such as stroke,15 coronary heart disease16 and cancer.17 Researchers have also concluded that compounds called limonoids, typically found in citrus fruits such as limes,18 may decrease risk for lung, breast, stomach, colon, skin and mouth cancers.19

A 2013 animal study discovered that lime juice and peel helped decrease the risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) among animal subjects. Researchers also highlighted that the peels were actually more effective compared to the beverage.20 In another article, lime peels were found to have antioxidant properties, showing potential in fighting free radicals that can damage the body’s cells, trigger aging and increase your risk for diseases.</p>

    <h4>Studies on limes</h4>
    <p>Research has shown that sun, salt and lime juice are ingredients that may provide clean, inexpensive water in areas of the world where it's unavailable. While the solar disinfection of drinking water (SODIS) method (exposing glass containers of water to six hours of sunlight) is already utilized in some African, Asian and Latin American countries, there are still challenges linked to it.

For instance, some parts of the world only have dirty water available, and lack filters that may make the water less murky, preventing the sun’s rays from stimulating the purification process and rendering this method possibly ineffective. However,  a 2012 Environmental Health Perspectives study suggests that adding tiny amounts of salt to the water causes it to adhere to and weigh down dirt particles.22

In further testing, the addition of lime juice resulted in a faster disinfecting ability, due to large quantities of psoralen compounds present in the fruit. These compounds bond with DNA strands in the presence of sunlight, thereby preventing DNA replication. Overall, results showed that the addition of a lime slurry or plain lime juice to the SODIS method helped reduced the amount of E. coli bacteria by about a million times in just 30 minutes, compared to using  the SODIS method alone, said to only be one-fourth as effective.23

In a Nigerian children's hospital, lime juice was tested as a treatment for parasites. When antimalarial medicines were given with the juice, researchers found that the combination significantly lowered parasite load. A higher percentage of subjects given both the medication and the juice also experienced complete recovery within 72 hours. Meanwhile, the treatment failed in subjects who were only given the medication without the lime juice.24

Lime juice was also found to exhibit antibacterial effects against the Vibrio cholera bacteria, as revealed in a 2000 Tropical Medicine and International Health article. According to authors, in places where cholera epidemics had occurred, particularly in Guinea-Bissau located in West Africa, the inclusion of lime juice in meals helped protect against development and transmission of the bacteria responsible for cholera.</p>
