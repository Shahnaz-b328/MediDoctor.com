  <h2>What Are Bananas Good For?</h2>
  <p>There are many reasons why bananas are one of the most popular foods in the world: They offer the perfect portion size, come in their own handy, natural protective wrap and are extremely economical.

Bananas are among the most important crops and most cultivated tropical fruits worldwide.1 They’re a close relative of the plantain, which is larger and darker.2

Fresh and creamy, bananas go well with other fruits and are a favorite lunchtime addition or for noshing on the go. Read on to learn more about the benefits of bananas to your health.</p>


    <h4>Health Benefits of Bananas</h4>
    <p>Over centuries, bananas have been used to help stimulate brainpower and relieve a variety of health issues, including upset stomach, stress, acidity, constipation and premenstrual symptoms.3 ,4 Their long list of nutrients accounts for their medical uses.

For one, bananas contain health-promoting flavonoids and phenolics such as lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene and alpha-carotene,5 all of which act as free radical-fighting antioxidants.6 They’re also high in vitamin C, which is known for its infection-fighting properties, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which may help prevent anemia and coronary artery disease.7

A 100-gram serving of raw banana contains 358 milligrams of potassium,8 a mineral that may help regulate your heart rate and blood pressure. Bananas are excellent source of dietary fiber as well, which may help maintain optimal gut health.9 Some of the other nutrients that bananas provide include:

Magnesium — Helps support healthy function of your heart, kidneys and muscles. It also aids in the production of energy in your body, helps improve mitochondrial health, and promotes mental and physical relaxation.
Manganese — Plays a role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and cholesterol. It also helps activate the antioxidant enzyme and support bone development.10
Folate — Necessary for the creation of DNA and other genetic materials, folate also helps lower the risk for cancer and birth defects.</p>

    <h4>Studies Done on Bananas</h4>
    <p>Research showed that among fruits and vegetables proven to be associated with cutting your risk of renal cell carcinoma, bananas were the highest.12 Another study showed that bananas, which are rich in vitamin A and carotenoids, have the potential to help lower your risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other types of cancer.13

More positive proof of banana’s singular health benefits emerged in a study showing an important link between foods containing high levels of potassium, magnesium, calcium and fiber — like bananas, for instance — and a reduction in the risk of stroke in men.14</p>
