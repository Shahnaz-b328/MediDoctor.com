  <h2>What Is Bilberry Good For?</h2>
  <p>Bilberry is a shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. This family contains around 3,500 species, most of which are shrubs as well, and are identified by their alternating leaves that have no stipules. Well-known examples include blueberry, Labrador tea and bilberry.1 The last example in particular, is native to Europe and typically grows in heaths, meadows and forests. Throughout different periods, it has been known as whortleberry, huckleberry and blaeberry.2</p>



    <h4>What Is Bilberry?</h4>
    <p>Bilberry is a shrub often confused with blueberry due to their similar appearances. However, there are ways to distinguish them from each other. Bilberry fruits usually measure 3 to 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter, compared to blueberries, which measure roughly 5 to 13 mm in diameter. Bilberry is softer compared to blueberry as well, and the taste is sweet, with a slight tart and acidic quality.3

The plant itself is very small. It typically only reaches a height of 6 to 12 inches, and very little maintenance is needed. It can thrive in the wild, especially in soil that has poor nutrition and high acidity.4 However, you can grow it in your home as well using seeds.

Bilberry thrives best in a cool climate, but it can also grow in warmer locations as long as you have partial sun with an afternoon shade. As for watering, it should be done whenever the soil dries out. Expect the berries to appear and ripen in autumn.5</p>

    <h4>The Health Benefits of Bilberry</h4>
    <p>Consuming bilberry may provide positive effects on your health. It has been known to help with the following:

• Maintaining Eye Health

Bilberry is largely known for its benefits in helping promote eye health. According to a World War II legend, the U.K.’s Royal Air Force pilots consumed bilberry before flying on nighttime missions. It was believed that consuming the fruit helped improve their ability to see in the dark, which gave them good accuracy.6

There may be some truth to this claim, as several studies have examined the ocular benefits of bilberries since then. In one study, a combination of bilberry anthocyanins (a type of antioxidant) and vitamin E had a 97 percent success rate in preventing cataract progression.7 In another study, bilberry was found to help fight against endotoxin-induced uveitis (inflammation of the uvea) in mice.8

• Maintaining Heart Health

Consuming this tiny fruit may provide big benefits for your heart. According to one study wherein participants consumed moderate amounts of bilberry for eight weeks, researchers noted that the berries helped decrease HDL (good) cholesterol levels, and helped improve platelet function and blood pressure.

• Lowering the Risk of Cancer and DNA Damage

The berry family is rich in anthocyanins that can help lower your risk of cancer and protect your DNA from damage. In a 2004 study, researchers discovered that consuming anthocyanin-rich foods can help inhibit key regulators that can lead to cancer, as well as helping reduce tumor growth.9

• Reducing Inflammation

Inflammation is your body’s defense mechanism when it deals with disease and eliminating pathogens. However, when it becomes chronic, it can affect your quality of life. In this regard, the anthocyanins of bilberry can help reduce your risk of unwanted inflammation.

In a study published in The Journal of Nutrition, researchers noted that participants who consumed anthocyanin-rich bilberry extracts helped inhibit factors that stimulate inflammatory response in their bodies. They went on to suggest that anthocyanin foods may have a positive effect on alleviating chronic inflammatory diseases.10

• Controlling Diabetes

In Europe, bilberry is one of the most popular natural choices to help control diabetes and provide relief from its symptoms.11 The compounds in bilberry can help lower blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin secretion, according to results gathered from an animal study.12
