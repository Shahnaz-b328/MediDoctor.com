  <h2>What are blackberries good for?</h2>
	<p>Nothing says “summer” like a fresh fruit salad, and if blackberries aren’t in the mix, you’re definitely missing out! Sweet and succulent, this fruit belongs to the same family as dewberries and raspberries.

Blackberries, which grow on thorny bushes called brambles1 are native to Europe2 but are now also grown commercially in the U.S.3 Blackberries grow well in a wide range of soils 4 although good drainage is necessary. If you want to grow them yourself, remember to plant them in an area where they will be exposed to direct sunlight.5 While blackberries may be available all year round,6 they may thrive best during late summer and fall.7

Blackberries have a sweet and tart flavor,8 making them a perfect addition to salads or smoothies.9 They can also be used as a yogurt topping,10 mixed into sauces that complement meat recipes11 or enjoyed by themselves12 as a light snack or dessert best consumed in moderation.13

While blackberries can be easily stored, they’re highly perishable14 and delicate.15 To lengthen the freshness and prevent spoilage, avoid washing them unless you plan to eat them.16</p>

    <h4>Health benefits of blackberries</h4>
   <p>The nutritional content of blackberries makes for an extensive list. Blackberries are loaded with vitamin C — a 100-gram serving has 21.0 milligrams of this vitamin — but are low in sodium and calories, with only 43 calories per serving. They are an excellent source of soluble and insoluble fiber,20 containing 5.3 grams all in all.21 Blackberries are also home to vitamins A, E and K, B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6 and B12), minerals such as copper, manganese, magnesium and potassium, and other nutrients such as pantothenic acid22 and folic acid.23,24

Blackberries are also valued for their antioxidant capabilities, as they contain  phytochemicals25 such as lutein, zeaxanthin,26 anthocyanins, catechins,27 ellagic acid, tannins, gallic acid, quercetin, cyanidins, kaempferol28 and salicylic acid.29,30

Such compounds may help scavenge free radicals31 and reactive oxygen species (ROS)32 that play a role in aging and chronic diseases.33 In particular, anthocyanins, which are responsible for the fruit’s color, were suggested to help protect against aging,34 inflammation,35 cancer36 and other neurological diseases.37,38

Results from a 2000 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry study noted that when they’re at their “green stages,” blackberries tend to have high-ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) activity, allowing them to be considered a valuable source of antioxidants.39

    <h4>Studies done on blackberries</h4>
    <p>There is a growing body of research claiming that berries have cancer-fighting abilities.41,42 Blackberries are rich in cyanidin 3-glucoside,43 ellagic acid,44 lignans45 and the flavonoid myricetin46 — substances that may have cancer-protective properties.47,48,49,50,51,52 A 2010 Breast Cancer and Research article revealed that a lower death risk was recorded among postmenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of plant lignans.53

Cyanidin 3-glucoside, according to authors of a 2011 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry study, may possess chemotherapeutic and chemo-protective activities.54 Ellagic acid, another potent ingredient in blackberries, has been shown to inhibit cancer formation,55,56 while myricetin may promote antioxidant action.57

Blackberries may also have beneficial effects on your brain health. In another Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry study, published in 2012, high antioxidant levels in blackberries, strawberries and other berries are found to help manage age-related memory loss.58 Study authors further reiterated in a Science Daily article that:59</p>
