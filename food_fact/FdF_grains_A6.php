  <h2>What Are Lentils Good For?</h2>
  <p>Vegans and non-vegetarians often welcome lentils (Lens culinaris) into their diets because of its versatility in cooking. Lentils also provide numerous dishes with a boost in both protein and fiber content, nutrients that are essential for optimal body function.

Lentils have been part of the human diet since the early civilizations, with traces of domesticated lentils being found on the banks of the Euphrates River. The pioneer civilizations also included lentils in their diet, with Greeks actually considering it as “poor man’s food.”

This, however, is contrary to the Egyptian civilization where lentils were actually found inside the tombs of pharaohs, implying that lentils were often held in high esteem in ancient Egyptian culture. Nowadays, lentils are considered a staple in various cuisines around the world.1

Lentils come in a handful of varieties that differ in color, texture and taste. Some of the most common types of lentils include black, green and the red varieties. Black lentils, also known as beluga, are famous for their similarity to caviar. They are often cooked in both cold and warm salads. Green lentils are the most widely available variety of lentils and are one of the easiest legumes to cook. They are often added to side dishes and soups.

Meanwhile, red lentils, which can actually be red, yellow or gold, are widely used in Indian cuisine. It’s the main ingredient in dal, an Indian stew that is often served with rice. Red lentils often break down to a puree-like consistency once cooked, which makes them a good ingredient for soups.2

Having been deemed as a superfood, it comes as no surprise that lentils actually offer impressive amounts of vitamins and minerals that your body would be happy to acquire. Continue reading to get more information about this legume and how you can incorporate it into your diet.

    <h4>Get These Health Benefits From Lentils</h4>
    <p>Due to the high amount of protein in lentils, those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet are highly advised to consume this food because of its high protein content. But even if you’re not vegan or vegetarian, incorporating this food into your diet will give you a plethora of health benefits, as lentils give your body essential vitamins and minerals. Here are some of the health benefits you can get from lentils:3

Lowers the risk for cardiovascular disease. Lentils contain fiber and folate. Studies suggest that eating high-fiber foods helps decrease the risk for heart disease, while magnesium helps regulate blood circulation.4
Slows the rate of digestion and sugar absorption. The high fiber content of lentils help slow down the rate of digestion. This leads to the slower absorption of glucose, helping regulate blood sugar levels.
May help in the prevention of birth defects in pregnant women. Lentils contain high amounts of folate, a mineral necessary for preventing neural tube defects in unborn babies. Insufficient folate intake often cause spinal cord defects and may even lead to brain development problems.5
Aids in weight loss. Lentils are low in calories, filling and nutrient-dense. This means that one serving of lentils usually prolongs the period before hunger sets in again, limiting or decreasing the calories that you take in throughout the day.6</p>
