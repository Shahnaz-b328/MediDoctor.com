  <h2>What is Cinnamon Good for</h2>
  <p>Cinnamon is a highly delicious spice.It has been prized for its medicinal properties for thousands of years.Modern science has now confirmed what people have known for ages.Here are 10 health benefits of cinnamon that are supported by scientific research.Cinnamon is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees. The inner bark is then extracted and the woody parts removed.When it dries, it forms strips that curl into rolls, called cinnamon sticks. These sticks can be ground to form cinnamon powder.The distinct smell and flavor of cinnamon are due to the oily part, which is very high in the compound cinnamaldehyde.Scientists believe that this compound is responsible for most of cinnamon's powerful effects on health and metabolism.

Traditional uses for acai fruit has included treatment for diarrhea, parasitic infections, hemorrhages and ulcers. As a food, acai pulp in the tribal Amazon belt is often blended with the starchy root vegetable manioc and eaten as porridge.

The taste is often described as reminiscent of wild berries and chocolate. It's found in large supermarkets and health food stores throughout the world, usually as a juice or tea rather than fresh, simply because getting them out of the Amazon with the nutrients still intact is a complicated process.

Other uses for the acai berry include natural food coloring, cosmetics, anti-aging skin creams, shampoos and conditioners, and also in food supplements. Expensive acai-based products have been widely hyped as having significant weight loss potential, but on that score, scientifically speaking, the jury's still out. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission announced in early 2012 that it had asked federal courts to temporarily suspend the activity of websites marketing acai berry weight loss products.</p>


    <h4>Health Benefits of Cinnamon</h4>
    <p>TAntioxidants protect your body from oxidative damage caused by free radicals.Cinnamon is loaded with powerful antioxidants, such as polyphenols.In a study that compared the antioxidant activity of 26 spices, cinnamon wound up as the clear winner, even outranking "superfoods" like garlic and oregano.In fact, it is so powerful that cinnamon can be used as a natural food preservative.
Cinnamon has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, the world's most common cause of premature death.In people with type 2 diabetes, 1 gram or about half a teaspoon of cinnamon per day has been shown to have beneficial effects on blood markers.It reduces levels of total cholesterol, “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while “good” HDL cholesterol remains stable.
More recently, a big review study concluded that a cinnamon dose of just 120 mg per day can have these effects. In this study, cinnamon also increased “good” HDL cholesterol levels.
In animal studies, cinnamon has been shown to reduce blood pressure.When combined, all these factors may drastically cut your risk of heart disease.Cinnamon may improve some key risk factors for heart disease, including cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure.Cinnamon Can Improve Sensitivity to the Hormone Insulin Insulin is one of the key hormones that regulate metabolism and energy use.
It’s also essential for transporting blood sugar from your bloodstream to your cells.
The problem is that many people are resistant to the effects of insulin.
This is known as insulin resistance, a hallmark of serious conditions like metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
The good news is that cinnamon can dramatically reduce insulin resistance, helping this important hormone do its job.By increasing insulin sensitivity, cinnamon can lower blood sugar levels, as discussed in the next chapter.</p>

    <h4>Studies Done on Cinnamon</h4>
    <p>A study published in mid-2011 reported that the acaí berry not only offers potential health benefits due to its antioxidant scavenging capacities, but also suppresses biological activity that would degrade cellular integrity.1

Research published in September 2012 reported the effects of acai berry pulp on chemically-induced urothelial bladder cancer in mice, and the incidence and multiplicity of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). After 10 weeks of treatment, the acai berry pulp treatment was found to reduce the TCC incidence, multiplicity, and tumor cell proliferation, as well as significantly reduce DNA damage. The study authors reported that the positive acai berry pulp treatment was probably due to the fruit's antioxidant abilities.2

The purpose of another study was to evaluate how acai fruit pulp affected metabolic disorder risks. It involved 10 overweight adults taking 100 grams of acai pulp twice daily for a month. Prior to the study, each subject's blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other biomarkers were measured.

At the end of the 30-day trial, researchers found reductions in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and total cholesterol; however, there was no effect on blood pressure. Scientists concluded that the acai fruit pulp reduced the levels of selected metabolic disease markers in the overweight subjects, indicating that further studies, including those on heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes, are warranted.3</p>
