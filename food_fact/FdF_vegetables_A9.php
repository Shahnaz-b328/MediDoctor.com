  <h2>Bitter Melon Benefits You Should Know About</h2>
  <p>Bitter melon boasts a variety of essential vitamins and minerals needed for the smooth function of the body.1

But aside from these healthful components, bitter melon contains active compounds that may help combat or even improve some of the most common chronic diseases today. Here’s everything you need to know about it.</p>


    <h4>What Is Bitter Melon?</h4>
    <p>The easiest way to identify a bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is through its rough and wrinkled skin, which some might even call “warty.”2 But while the fruit might appear off-putting, bitter melon is actually famous for its effects on obesity and diabetes.3

Bitter melon, also called bitter gourd or Indian bitter melon, is a climbing shrub that typically grows in countries with a tropical climate. The bitter melon plant is a relatively fast-growing plant characterized by its thin stems, tendrils and bright yellow flowers that only bloom for a day.

Bitter melon fruits usually start off with a light green shade and become yellow or orange as they ripen.4 Native to India and other countries with warmer climates, bitter melon fruits are usually prepared in dishes, while the leaves are used in teas and soups. But aside from its culinary uses, bitter melon is also used as a traditional medicine in China, India and South America, specifically for tumors, asthma, skin and digestive problems.

One of the most well-known uses for bitter melon is for the management of diabetes, as the fruit contains three different components that help in blood sugar regulation, namely charantin, peptides and alkaloids</p>

    <h4>Get These Bitter Melon Benefits Today</h4>
    <p>ome of the benefits you can obtain from adding bitter melon to your diet are:

May improve blood sugar regulation. Bitter melon contains hypoglycemic compounds, which may help improve your body’s ability to utilize sugar for energy. In a 2018 placebo-controlled trial published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, bitter melon and cucumber juice were given to prediabetics. After a few weeks of administration, the individuals given bitter melon juice had significantly lowered fasting plasma glucose levels.6
Bitter melon may also help boost fat metabolism, which may contribute to the prevention of obesity, which is one of the risk factors of diabetes.7 In an animal study done in 2016, bitter melon extracts were found to effectively reduce adiposity in obese mice by promoting balance in lipid intake and metabolism.8

In addition, it has been found to significantly help improve insulin sensitivity. In a study done by the Philippine Department of Health, they found that bitter melon has the same mechanism as glibenclamide, an anti-diabetes drug.9 

Aids the immune system. Bitter melon is said to contribute to better immune function,10 as it is filled with numerous antioxidants and other essential nutrients, one of which is vitamin C. It contains about 55 milligrams of vitamin C per serving, which is an essential micronutrient for improved immunity as it supports cellular function and oxidant scavenging.11
Might reduce/prevent inflammation. Numerous studies show that the different components of bitter melon lend it its anti-inflammatory properties. A 2018 study published in the journal Phytomedicine showed that a peptide extracted from bitter melon seeds helps in alleviating inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.12 Another 2018 animal study shows that the administration of bitter melon polysaccharides may help in reducing gastric inflammation and oxidative stress.13</p>
