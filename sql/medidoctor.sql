(1, 'Allergy', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Allergy</h2>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;What causes allergies?</h4>\r\n<p>A common scenario can help explain how allergies develop. A few months after the new cat arrives in the house, dad begins to have itchy eyes and episodes of sneezing. One of the three children develops coughing and wheezing. The mom and the other two children experience no reaction despite the presence of the cat. How can this occur?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The immune system is the body\'s organized defense mechanism against foreign invaders, particularly infections. Its job is to recognize and react to these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Who is at risk for allergies and why?</h4>\r\n<p>Allergies can develop at any age, but most food allergies begin at a young age, and many are outgrown. Environmental allergies can develop at any time. The initial exposure or sensitization period may even begin before birth. Individuals can also outgrow allergies over time. It is not fully understood why one person develops allergies and another does not, but there are several risk factors for allergic conditions. Family history, or genetics, plays a large role, with a higher risk for allergies if parents or siblings have allergies. There are numerous other risk factors for developing allergic conditions. Children born via Cesarean section have a higher risk of allergy as compared to children who are delivered vaginally. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution increases the risk of allergy. Boys are more likely to be allergic than girls. Allergies are more common in westernized countries, and less common in those with a farming lifestyle. Timing of exposures to antigens, use of antibiotics, and numerous other factors, some of which are not yet known, also contribute to the development of allergies. This complicated process continues to be an area of medical research.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">What are common types of allergic conditions, and what are allergy symptoms and signs?</h4>\r\n<p>The parts of the body that are prone to allergic symptoms include the eyes, nose, lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although the various allergic diseases may appear different, they all result from an exaggerated immune response to foreign substances in sensitive individuals. The following are brief descriptions of common allergic disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Allergic rhinitis (hay fever)</p>\r\n<p>Asthma&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Allergic eyes (conjunctivitis)</p>\r\n<p>Eczema (atopic dermatitis)</p>\r\n<p>Hives (urticaria)</p>\r\n<p>Anaphylaxis</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">How do health care professionals diagnose allergies? What are the types of allergy testing?</h4>\r\n<p>he diagnosis of allergies begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Many people with allergies have other family members with allergic conditions. In addition to the history and exam, skin testing and sometimes blood work (specific IgE levels) can help with the diagnosis of allergies. There are several important considerations when interpreting the results of this testing:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For environmental allergies such as pets, dust mites, pollen, and molds, skin prick testing is the best test to help with diagnosis of allergy. Blood work looking for the allergic antibody (IgE) is less sensitive and may miss some allergies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For food allergy testing, the most important part of the diagnosis is the health history. Skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) should only be ordered if the history is suggestive of food allergy. Without a suggestive history, food allergy skin testing and blood work is not very specific and has a high rate of false positive results.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For food allergy testing, ordering skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) for broad panels of foods is discouraged, given the high rate of false positive results.</p>\r\n<p>For drug allergy, the history is the most important element in diagnosis. The only antibiotic with validated skin testing is penicillin. Penicillin skin testing can be very helpful in determining if an individual is truly allergic to penicillin and related antibiotics. Blood work (specific IgE testing) is not particularly helpful for the diagnosis of drug allergies.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, such as with food allergy and drug allergy, despite a detailed history and appropriate testing, the diagnosis of allergy remains unclear. In these situations, it is appropriate to consider a &ldquo;graded challenge,&rdquo; which is the &ldquo;gold standard,&rdquo; or the best test, for the diagnosis of allergies. A graded challenge should always be performed with an allergist in a setting equipped to manage a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'),

Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.</p>\r\n<p>he parts of the body that are prone to allergic symptoms include the eyes, nose, lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although the various allergic diseases may appear different, they all result from an exaggerated immune response to foreign substances in sensitive individuals. The following are brief descriptions of common allergic disorders.</p>'),

A lot of people don\'t realise they\'re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there\'s a problem.</p>\r\n<p>Different types of depression</p>\r\n<p>There are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:</p>\r\n<p>â— Bipolar disorder &ndash; people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as \"manic depression\", experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as \"mania\"). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.</p>\r\n<p>â— Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also called \"winter depression\". It\'s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.</p>\r\n<p>â— Postnatal depression happens to some women after they\'ve had a baby. It\'s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.</p>\r\n<p>Learn more about how depression is diagnosed here.</p>\r\n<p>Causes of depression</p>\r\n<p>Depression doesn\'t have one single cause &ndash; it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.</p>\r\n<p>Different reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you\'re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s common to hear about depression being brought on by a \"downward spiral\" &ndash; one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.</p>\r\n<p>There are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There\'s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.</p>'),

Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p>There are two main types of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:</p>\r\n<p>â— non-small-cell lung cancer &ndash; the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma</p>\r\n<p>â— small-cell lung cancer &ndash; a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer</p>\r\n<p>The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of lung cancer</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.</p>\r\n<p>The main symptoms of lung cancer are listed below. If you have any of these, you should see your GP:</p>\r\n<p>â— a cough that doesn&rsquo;t go away after two or three weeks</p>\r\n<p>â— a long-standing cough that gets worse</p>\r\n<p>â— persistent chest infections</p>\r\n<p>â— coughing up blood</p>\r\n<p>â— an ache or pain when breathing or coughing</p>\r\n<p>â— persistent breathlessness</p>\r\n<p>â— persistent tiredness or lack of energy</p>\r\n<p>â— loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss</p>\r\n<p>Less common symptoms of lung cancer include:</p>\r\n<p>â— changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)</p>\r\n<p>â— a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>â— difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing</p>\r\n<p>â— wheezing</p>\r\n<p>â— a hoarse voice&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>â— swelling of your face or neck</p>\r\n<p>â— persistent chest or shoulder pain</p>\r\n<p>Causes of lung cancer</p>\r\n<p>Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.</p>\r\n<p>Smoking</p>\r\n<p>Smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. It\'s responsible for more than 85% of all cases.</p>\r\n<p>Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can lead to the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).</p>\r\n<p>If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.</p>\r\n<p>While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer. These products include:</p>\r\n<p>â— cigars</p>\r\n<p>â— pipe tobacco</p>\r\n<p>â— snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)</p>\r\n<p>â— chewing tobacco</p>\r\n<p>Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco. While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s been estimated that smoking four joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.</p>\r\n<p>Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Passive smoking</p>\r\n<p>If you don\'t smoke, frequent exposure to other people&rsquo;s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p>For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'),

(3, 'Abdominal Pain in Children', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Abdominal Pain in Children</h2>\r\n<p>Children often complain of stomach pain. It is one of the most common reasons parents take children to their doctor or the hospital emergency department. Stomach pain can be hard to diagnose. The doctor will ask you questions then examine your child. Sometimes a problem may be quite obvious, so no tests are needed. <br /><br />Many children with stomach pain get better in hours or days without special treatment and often no cause can be found. Sometimes the cause becomes more obvious with time and treatment can be started. If pain or other problems persist, see your doctor.</p>\r\n<h3>Causes of abdominal pain in children</h3>\r\n<p><br />There are many health problems that can cause stomach pain for children, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>bowel (gut) problems &ndash; constipation, colic or irritable bowel</li>\r\n<li>infections &ndash; gastroenteritis, kidney or bladder infections, or infections in other parts of the body like the ear or chest</li>\r\n<li>food-related problems &ndash; too much food, food poisoning or food allergies</li>\r\n<li>problems outside the abdomen &ndash; muscle strain or migraine</li>\r\n<li>surgical problems &ndash; appendicitis, bowel obstruction or intussusception (telescoping of part of the gut)</li>\r\n<li>period pain &ndash; some girls can have pain before their periods start</li>\r\n<li>poisoning &ndash; such as spider bites, eating soap or smoking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Repeat attacks of stomach pain</h3>\r\n<p>Some children suffer repeat attacks of stomach pain, which can be worrying for parents. Often, no health problem can be found.<br /><br />Children may feel stomach pain when they are worried about themselves or people around them. Think about whether there is anything that is upsetting your child at home, school or kindergarten, or with friends. See your local doctor for advice. A referral may be needed to a pediatrician (a doctor who specialises in children).</p>\r\n<h3>Appendicitis explained</h3>\r\n<p>Appendicitis is one of the more common reasons your child may need surgery. The appendix is a small, dead-end tube leading from a part of the bowel. If this tube gets blocked, it can cause an infection. Appendicitis can happen at any age, but is rare in young children. <br /><br />The pain often starts in the middle of the tummy and moves down low on the right side. The tummy becomes sore to touch. This is often worse with coughing and walking around. A child with appendicitis often shows signs of being unwell such as fever, refusing food, vomiting or (sometimes) diarrhoea. <br /><br />If you are concerned your child may be developing appendicitis, visit your local doctor or go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital. An operation is often needed to remove the appendix, although in some cases the problem will settle without surgery.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"lp-h-1\" style=\"outline: currentcolor none medium;\" tabindex=\"-1\">Diagnosis of abdominal pain in children</h3>\r\n<p>When a problem is quite obvious, no tests are needed. If tests are needed, they may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>blood tests</li>\r\n<li>urine test</li>\r\n<li>stool (poo) sample</li>\r\n<li>x-rays</li>\r\n<li>other special tests</li>\r\n<li>review by a specialist doctor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If your child does undergo tests, the doctor should explain the results to you. Some results may take a number of days to come back and these results will be sent to your local doctor.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3 id=\"lp-h-2\" style=\"outline: currentcolor none medium;\" tabindex=\"-1\">Treatment for abdominal pain in children</h3>\r\n<p>Your child&rsquo;s treatment will depend on what the doctor thinks is causing their pain. Treatment may be as simple as sending your child home with advice to rest, take fluids and eat a bland diet. Other treatment options include hospital admission and surgery.</p>', 'uploadimg/19ec4969cd.jpg'),
(4, '	Abdominal Pain', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Abdominal Pain</h2>\r\n<h3 class=\"mshs-heading\">Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious.</p>\r\n<p>How bad your pain does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.</p>\r\n<p>For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis.</p>\r\n<p>However, fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain.</p>\r\n<p>Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Generalized pain -- This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Localized pain -- This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Cramp-like pain -- This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"mshs-heading\">Causes</h3>\r\n<p>Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to call a health care provider if your symptoms continue.</p>\r\n<p>Less serious causes of abdominal pain include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Constipation</li>\r\n<li>Food allergies or intolerance</li>\r\n<li>Food poisoning</li>\r\n<li>Stomach flu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other possible causes include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cancer of the stomach, colon (large bowel), and other organs</li>\r\n<li>Inflammation of the gallbladder with or without gallstones</li>\r\n<li>Decreased blood supply to the intestines</li>\r\n<li>Inflammation and infection of the colon)</li>\r\n<li>Heatbur,indigation, or gastroesophagel reflux (GERD)</li>\r\n<li>Inflammatory bowel disease</li>\r\n<li>Kidney stones</li>\r\n<li>Pancreatitis (swelling or infection of the pancreas)</li>\r\n<li>Ulcers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Sometimes, abdominal pain may occur due to a problem somewhere else in your body, such as your chest or pelvic area.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Colicky pain -- This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"mshs-heading\">Home Care</h3>\r\n<p>You can try the following home care steps to ease mild abdominal pain:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sip water or other clear fluids. You may have sports drinks in small amounts. People with diabetes must check their blood sugar often and adjust their medicines as needed.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid solid food for the first few hours.</li>\r\n<li>If you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Avoid dairy products.</li>\r\n<li>If the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages.</li>\r\n<li>DO NOT take any medicine without talking to your provider.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These additional steps may help prevent some types of abdominal pain:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Drink plenty of water each day.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Eat small meals more frequently.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Exercise regularly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Limit foods that produce gas.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Make sure that your meals are well-balanced and high in fiber.

(1, 'Bruises', '<h3>What is Bruises</h3>\r\n<p>You fall off your bike, bang your shin on the coffee table (that you swore you would move months ago), or run into a wall and wake up with a bruise. What is a bruise, and what can you do about it? A bruise is caused when tiny blood vessels are damaged or broken as the result of trauma to the skin (be it bumping against something or hitting yourself with a hammer). The raised area of a bump or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood vessels into the tissues as well as from the body\'s response to the injury. A bruise is medically referred to as a contusion. A purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is referred to as an ecchymosis.</p>\r\n<h3>What are the symptoms of bruises and why it changes color?</h3>\r\n<p>Bruises can be associated with tenderness of the involved discolored area. Bruises change in appearance over time, and it may be possible to tell by looking at a bruise how old it is. When it first appears, a bruise will be reddish looking, reflecting the color of the blood in the skin. By one to two days, the reddish iron from the blood undergoes a change and the bruise will appear blue or purple. By day six, the color changes to green and by day eight to nine, the bruise will appear yellowish-brown. In general, the bruised area will be repaired by the body in two to three weeks after which the skin will return to normal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>There are a couple of things that you can do to prevent or minimize bruising after an injury. First, try a cold compress. Put ice in a plastic bag, wrap the bag in a towel (applying the ice directly to the skin can causefrostbite), and place it on the injured area. Commercial ice packs are also available, but a bag of frozen peas makes an excellent substitute. It molds to the shape of the injured area and can then be re-frozen and used again (but don\'t eat them!). The cold reduces the blood flow to the area and therefore limits bleeding into the skin and reduces the size of the bruise. The cold also decreases the inflammation in the area of the injury and limits swelling in this way as well. If possible, elevate the area above the level of the heart. The lower an extremity is below the heart, the more blood will flow to the area and increase the bleeding and swelling.</p>\r\n<p>Avoid taking the medications listed above that can contribute to bruising. If you have any questions about whether or not your medication can contribute to bruising, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Do not stop any prescription medications without first contacting your doctor.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, pressure applied to the area (by hand, not with tourniquets) can reduce bleeding.</p>\r\n<p>People who take medicines that reduce clotting (\"blood thinners\") or have clotting abnormalities should seek the advice of a physician immediately, as should the elderly or those who have experienced significantly severe trauma.</p>', 'uploadimg/15844e9bb4.jpg'),
(2, 'Burn', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Burns</h2>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p><br />A burn is an injury to the skin resulting from direct contact or exposure from extreme heat or cold, friction, electricity, or chemicals. First-degree burns are superficial with red skin, pain, and no blistering. Second-degree burns involve destruction of the second layer of skin, causing blistering, swelling, and pain. Third-degree burns involve the destruction of all layers of the skin, including fat, muscle, blood supply, and sometimes bone. Third-degree burns do not have pain associated with them.<br /><br />Airway burns can affect the nose, throat, and windpipe and are typically caused by inhaling smoke, steam, or toxic fumes. The airway swells, which can cause suffocation. It is often difficult to determine the extent of airway burns.<br /><br />It is important to try to assess the seriousness of a burn, which is determined, primarily, by the size of the burn and its depth. When in doubt, treat as a serious burn.<br /><br />All first-degree burns and all second-degree burns that are smaller than 2&ndash;3 inches in diameter are considered minor burns, and they can be treated as specified in the First Aid Guide below. Seek professional medical care for burns that do not fit the above criteria.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>General self-care measures for minor (first-degree and some second-degree) burns are as follows:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the affected area under cold water, or immerse the area in cold water for 10&ndash;15 minutes.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently pat the area dry with a clean or sterile cloth, and cover the area with a nonadhesive, sterile, dry dressing.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol), ibuprofen (eg, Advil, Motrin), naproxen (eg, Aleve), or aspirin (but never use aspirin in children or adolescents aged 18 years or younger).<br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the burn has healed, continue to apply clean, dry dressings, and change them daily.<br /><br />For severe (extensive second-degree and all third-degree) burns, contact emergency help immediately. While awaiting professional medical care, self-care measures are as follows:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid further contact with smoke or heat, but do not remove the person\'s clothes and do not immerse the burn areas in cold water.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct CPR if necessary.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cover the affected area with a cool, moist cloth or bandage.<br /><br />Burns caused by chemical exposure require quick first aid while awaiting medical care; doing so can lessen the chemical\'s harmful effects. Your local Poison Control Center can best provide this information. The following general measures can be taken while awaiting professional care.<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the chemical, including clothing or anything on the person that came in contact with it, taking care to not spread the chemical elsewhere.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continually flush the affected area with fresh water.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 15 minutes have passed, apply cool, wet compresses to help relieve pain.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protect the burn area from friction by covering it with a loose, dry, sterile dressing.<br /><br /></p>', 'uploadimg/6dd1bb6233.jpg'),
(4, 'Bleeding', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bleeding</h2>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Bleeding, also called hemorrhage, is the name used to describe blood loss. It can refer to blood loss inside the body, called internal bleeding, or to blood loss outside of the body, called external bleeding.</p>\r\n<p>Blood loss can occur in almost any area of the body. Internal bleeding occurs when blood leaks out through a damaged blood vessel or organ. External bleeding happens when blood exits through a break in the skin.</p>\r\n<p>Blood loss from bleeding tissue can also be apparent when blood exits through a natural opening in the body, such as the:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mouth</li>\r\n<li>vagina</li>\r\n<li>recume</li>\r\n<li>nose</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Bleeding is a common symptom. A variety of incidents or conditions can cause bleeding. Possible causes include:</p>\r\n<p>An injury can cause traumatic bleeding. Traumatic injuries vary in their severity.<br /><br />Common types of traumatic injury include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abrasions (scrapes) that don&rsquo;t penetrate too far below the skin<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hematoma or bruises<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lacerations (cuts)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; puncture wounds from items like needles, nails, or knives<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushing injuries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gunshot wounds</p>\r\n<p>Some medicines and certain treatments can increase your chances of bleeding, or even cause bleeding. Your doctor will warn you about this when they first prescribe the therapy. And they&rsquo;ll tell you what to do if bleeding occurs.<br /><br />Medications that may be responsible for bleeding include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blood thinners<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; antibiotics, when used on a long-term basis<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radiation therapy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aspirin and other NSAIDs<br /><br />When is bleeding a sign of an emergency?<br /><br />If bleeding is severe, seek help immediately. You should seek emergency help if you suspect internal bleeding. This can become life-threatening.<br /><br />People who have bleeding disorders or take blood thinners should also seek emergency help to stop bleeding.<br /><br />Seek medical help if:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the person has gone into shock or has a fever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bleeding cannot be controlled using pressure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wound requires a tourniquet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bleeding was caused by a serious injury<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wound may need stitches to stop bleeding<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreign objects are stuck inside the wound<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wound appears to be infected, such as swelling or leaking a whitish-yellow or brown pus, or has redness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the injury occurred due to a bite from an animal or human<br /><br />When you call for help, emergency services will tell you what to do and when they&rsquo;ll arrive.<br /><br />In most cases, emergency services will tell you to continue to put pressure on the wound and keep reassuring the person who&rsquo;s bleeding. You may also be told to lay the person down to reduce their risk of fainting.</p>', 'uploadimg/6687eccb0d.jpg'),
(5, 'Blisters', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bilsters</h2>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p><br /><br />A blister (bulla) is caused when the outer layer of the skin separates from a layer of skin below, creating a collection of fluid between the layers. Blisters can be caused by chemical means, such as an allergic reaction; physical injury, such as from heat, frostbite, or friction; or from a disease.<br />If the blister has been caused by a burn, see the Burns, First Aid write-up via the Disease List. If the blister has been caused by frostbite, see the Frostbite, First Aid write-up, which can also be found via the Disease List.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>Blisters often go away on their own without needing any care, and the skin over the blister is its best defense against infection. If the blister is large or painful, however, you can drain the blister in such a way as to relieve the discomfort and hopefully avoid infection.<br /><br />Note: Blisters that look like they will pop on their own should be drained, unless the blister looks infected or you have a fever; multiple, grouped blisters; diabetes; or poor circulation.<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean your hands and the affected area with soap and warm water.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply rubbing alcohol to the affected area.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wipe a needle with rubbing alcohol to sterilize it.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Puncture the blister with the sterilized needle at its edge, making the hole big enough to drain fluid.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the fluid drain, making sure to leave the overlying skin in place.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply an antibiotic ointment (eg, bacitracin) to the blister, and bandage the affected area.<br /><br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the overlying skin has dried, allow it to fall off naturally or use sterilized scissors to cut the dead skin off. Apply antibiotic ointment and a bandage, if necessary.<br /><br />Prevention of blisters is key. The following measures will help prevent blisters from occurring:<br /><br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear acrylic socks, particularly ones that fit you well. While cotton socks were once the recommendation to avoid blisters, they tend to become misshapen when wet and are never as form-fitting as acrylic socks.<br /><br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When picking out shoes, be sure to go shopping during the middle of the day, when your feet are slightly swollen. (Feet normally swell as the day goes on.) Make sure you can wiggle your toes, and be sure that both the left and right shoes fit properly. (Many people have two different size feet.)<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply powder to your feet before activity that may cause friction.<br /><br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear work gloves when using tools that cause friction on hands.</p>', 'uploadimg/820a2073b4.jpg');

Skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) should only be ordered if the history is suggestive of food allergy. Without a suggestive history, food allergy skin testing and blood work is not very specific and has a high rate of false positive results.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #231f20; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; For food allergy testing, ordering skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) for broad panels of foods is discouraged, given the high rate of false positive results.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #231f20; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">For drug allergy, the history is the most important element in diagnosis.

A few months after the new cat arrives in the house, dad begins to have itchy eyes and episodes of sneezing. One of the three children develops coughing and wheezing. The mom and the other two children experience no reaction despite the presence of the cat. How can this occur?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The immune system is the body\'s organized defense mechanism against foreign invaders, particularly infections. Its job is to recognize and react to these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.</p>\r\n<h4>Who is at risk for allergies and why</h4>\r\n<p>Eczema can develop at any age, but most food allergies begin at a young age, and many are outgrown. Environmental allergies can develop at any time. The initial exposure or sensitization period may even begin before birth. Individuals can also outgrow allergies over time. It is not fully understood why one person develops allergies and another does not, but there are several risk factors for allergic conditions. Family history, or genetics, plays a large role, with a higher risk for allergies if parents or siblings have allergies. There are numerous other risk factors for developing allergic conditions. Children born via Cesarean section have a higher risk of allergy as compared to children who are delivered vaginally. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution increases the risk of allergy. Boys are more likely to be allergic than girls. Allergies are more common in westernized countries, and less common in those with a farming lifestyle. Timing of exposures to antigens, use of antibiotics, and numerous other factors, some of which are not yet known, also contribute to the development of allergies. This complicated process continues to be an area of medical research.</p>', 'uploadimg/2ec03585ec.jpg');

Frostbite often starts out with mild symptoms and can progress and become quite severe and even limb-threatening.<br /><br />Mild frostbite is considered skin that is either red and painful, or white and numb. Severe frostbite includes blistering skin, hard skin (due to frozen bone and blood vessels), and possibly gangrene (tissue that has died and turned black, after blood vessels became frozen).<br /><br />Frostbite is often associated with hypothermia.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>In the case of mild frostbite, the following measures should be taken:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the person someplace that is warmer.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove clothing from the affected area.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rewarm the affected area until sensation in the skin has returned and the skin is soft (for at least 30 minutes). Rewarming of frostbitten skin is typically accompanied by pain, swelling, and color change.<br /><br />?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To rewarm an extremity, place the limb in a bath of warm water (ie, 100&deg;&ndash;105&deg; F). Continue to circulate and refresh the warm water.<br /><br />?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To rewarm an area that cannot be soaked in a bath of water, apply a warm compress.

If precautions to cool off and rehydrate at this point are not made, the more severe stage of heat illness, heat exhaustion, can occur in a rapid progression, resulting in a potentially life-threatening situation. The most severe form of heat illness is heat stroke, which may result in shock, brain damage, or death.<br />See the Heat Cramps or Heat Exhaustion texts via the Disease List for information specific to the earlier stages of heat illness.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>When heatstroke is suspected, seek emergency medical care immediately. While awaiting emergency medical services, try to cool the person as described below.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Use a combination of the following measures depending on the circumstances and means available:<br /><br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the person rest, legs slightly elevated, in a shaded area or cool or air-conditioned building, room, or car.<br /><br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove or loosen the person\'s clothes.<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the person an electrolyte drink, such as Gatorade&reg; or Pedialyte&reg;, or water if not available. Note: You can make a salted drink by adding 1 teaspoon of salt to one quart of water. Do not give beverages that contain caffeine or alcohol.<br /><br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrap the person in a wet cloth, and position a fan toward him/her. Evaporation of water on the skin aids in cooling.<br /><br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply cold compresses (eg, to neck, armpits, groin).</p>', 'uploadimg/c654b92ffb.jpg');

(3, 'Jellyfish Stings', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Jellyfish stings</h2>\r\n<p>A common scenario can help explain how allergies develop. A few months after the new cat arrives in the house, dad begins to have itchy eyes and episodes of sneezing. One of the three children develops coughing and wheezing. The mom and the other two children experience no reaction despite the presence of the cat. How can this occur?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The immune system is the body\'s organized defense mechanism against foreign invaders, particularly infections. Its job is to recognize and react to these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The parts of the body that are prone to allergic symptoms include the eyes, nose, lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although the various allergic diseases may appear different, they all result from an exaggerated immune response to foreign substances in sensitive individuals. The following are brief descriptions of common allergic disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploadimg/5d5fd34cf9.jpg');

Some oral medications used for other medical conditions, most commonly hydrochlorothiazide (a blood pressure medication) may make the skin more sensitive to sunburning.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>If you have suffered a sunburn:<br /><br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further direct sun exposure should be avoided for a few days.<br /><br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool water or cool milk soaks may help cool and soothe the affected areas.<br /><br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help decrease the redness and pain.<br /><br />d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying a greasy cream or ointment may actually make the pain worse by trapping the heat on the skin.<br /><br />e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink a lot of fluids.<br /><br />Do not attempt to break any blisters that may form; you can cover these with gauze if necessary. If any break on their own, a topical antibiotic ointment can be applied. A moisturizer can help with skin peeling afterward. Avoid topical products that end in \"-caine\" as they can sometimes further irritate the skin.<br /><br />Prevention is very important. To reduce risk of skin cancer later in life, sunburns should be prevented.&nbsp;<br /><br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid direct sun in the middle of the day (10 AM to 3 PM). Remember: snow and water reflect light to the skin, and clouds still let a lot of light through, so you may still be exposed to ultraviolet light even on cloudy days.<br /><br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a hat with a wide brim. A baseball hat does not give much protection.<br /><br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cover up with tightly woven clothing. Some manufacturers make specialty clothing with a high sun protection factor (SPF) rating, or you can purchase a special ingredient to be added to your washer that can \"wash\" SPF into your clothing.<br /><br />d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use sunscreen on all exposed skin areas, including the lips, before going outdoors. A broad spectrum (blocks UVB and UVA light), with an SPF of at least 30, is best. Apply generously 30 minutes before going outdoors, and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming or sweating a lot.<br /><br />e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not use tanning beds!</p>', 'uploadimg/4deb7134d7.jpg');

Certain ticks can even inject venom that causes temporary paralysis in their host (called tick paralysis).</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Guide</h3>\r\n<p>To remove an embedded tick:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash your hands.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean tweezers by boiling them or by pouring antiseptic solution (eg, isopropyl alcohol) over them.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With tweezers, grasp the tick as close to its head or mouth as possible, and pull it straight out with a slow and steady motion. Be careful not to leave the head embedded in the skin, and make sure all parts of the tick are completely removed. Note: Be sure to not twist the tick body as you pull it out.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash the area completely with soap and water.<br /><br />After the tick has been completely removed, watch for approximately the next few weeks for signs of infection or illness, particularly if the tick was likely attached for over 24 hours. (See When To Seek Medical Care.)</p>\r\n<h3><br />Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The most important thing to consider regarding ticks is that prevention of tick bites is key. While in wooded areas, tall grass, or brush, consider doing the following:<br /><br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear long pants and long sleeves.<br /><br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear your socks over the outside of your pant legs.<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuck your shirt into your pants.<br /><br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear light-colored clothes so that ticks can easily be spotted.<br /><br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spray your clothes and exposed skin with insect repellant.<br /><br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently check your clothes and skin for ticks.<br /><br />It is important to remove a tick within 24 hours, if possible. Once home, remove your clothes and thoroughly inspect all skin surface areas. Don\'t forget your scalp! As ticks can be quite small, carefully evaluate all black or brown spots on the skin.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploadimg/20077c24a4.jpg');

(1, 'ACAI', '<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">What is Acai Good for</h4>\r\n<p>Similar to a cross between a grape and a blueberry, the acai (pronounced ah-sigh-ee) berry is a small, reddish-purple drupe consisting of a cluster of seeds, with only around 15 percent or so being edible, harvested from tall, slender palm trees found around the Amazon River basin of South America. These berries are also quite perishable, but have significant nutritional attributes when eaten fresh.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Traditional uses for acai fruit has included treatment for diarrhea, parasitic infections, hemorrhages and ulcers. As a food, acai pulp in the tribal Amazon belt is often blended with the starchy root vegetable manioc and eaten as porridge.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The taste is often described as reminiscent of wild berries and chocolate. It\'s found in large supermarkets and health food stores throughout the world, usually as a juice or tea rather than fresh, simply because getting them out of the Amazon with the nutrients still intact is a complicated process.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other uses for the acai berry include natural food coloring, cosmetics, anti-aging skin creams, shampoos and conditioners, and also in food supplements. Expensive acai-based products have been widely hyped as having significant weight loss potential, but on that score, scientifically speaking, the jury\'s still out. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission announced in early 2012 that it had asked federal courts to temporarily suspend the activity of websites marketing acai berry weight loss products.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Acai&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>This little berry\'s list of attributes includes a high level of antioxidant activity similar to cranberries, but more than what\'s been found in blueberries and strawberries. Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) values measuring the antioxidant power of acai fruit pulp/skin powder reportedly have the highest ORAC value among fruits and vegetables, or 10 times more antioxidants than red grapes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Acai berries are low in sugar, but contain excellent amounts of calcium, fiber, and vitamin A. They also contain anthocyanin compounds such as resveratrol and cyaniding and ferulic acid, which not only give fruits and vegetables their distinct color, but also team up with flavonoids to defend the body against harmful free radicals. In fact, acai berries contain 10 to 30 times more anthocyanin power than red wine. Beneficial fatty acids such as oleic acid, one of the same oils found in olive oil, is another strong point, and healthy levels of dietary fiber keep the system functioning smoothly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The properties contained in acai berries may help prevent health problems such as arthritis, inflammation, obesity, erectile dysfunction, neurological diseases, and allergies. Lab studies have shown them to have positive effects on ailments associated with oxidative stress, heart disease, and cancer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Acai berries should be consumed in moderation, because they still contain sugar, even if in lower levels than other fruits. Remember, fructose may be harmful to your health in excessive amounts.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Studies Done on Acai</h4>\r\n<p>A study published in mid-2011 reported that the aca&iacute; berry not only offers potential health benefits due to its antioxidant scavenging capacities, but also suppresses biological activity that would degrade cellular integrity.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research published in September 2012 reported the effects of acai berry pulp on chemically-induced urothelial bladder cancer in mice, and the incidence and multiplicity of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). After 10 weeks of treatment, the acai berry pulp treatment was found to reduce the TCC incidence, multiplicity, and tumor cell proliferation, as well as significantly reduce DNA damage. The study authors reported that the positive acai berry pulp treatment was probably due to the fruit\'s antioxidant abilities.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of another study was to evaluate how acai fruit pulp affected metabolic disorder risks. It involved 10 overweight adults taking 100 grams of acai pulp twice daily for a month. Prior to the study, each subject\'s blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other biomarkers were measured.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the 30-day trial, researchers found reductions in fasting glucose, insulin levels, and total cholesterol; however, there was no effect on blood pressure. Scientists concluded that the acai fruit pulp reduced the levels of selected metabolic disease markers in the overweight subjects, indicating that further studies, including those on heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes, are warranted.</p>', 'uploadimg/dd11db4fdf.jpg'),
(4, 'Ackee', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Ackee Good For?</h2>\r\n<p>Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica,1 but it&rsquo;s actually native to the tropical forests of West Africa. It is believed that samples of the tree were brought to the Caribbean island in the 18th century and it&rsquo;s been there ever since.2</p>\r\n<p>The name &ldquo;ackee&rdquo; has African origins, and is derived from the word &ldquo;Ankye&rdquo; from the Twi language of Ghana. Its botanical name pays tribute to Captain William Bligh, who bought the plants from Jamaica to England in 1793 and introduced it to the Western world.3</p>\r\n<p>Since its introduction to Jamaican culture, ackee has become an integral part of its history due to its role in &ldquo;ackee and saltfish,&rdquo; the country&rsquo;s national dish.4 Today, it is exported around the world and enjoyed by countless people all over.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; What Is Ackee?</h2>\r\n<p>Ackee is classified as an evergreen tree, which means that it has foliage throughout the year.5 It can grow up to a height of 25 feet tall, despite having a short trunk. The crown can grow very large and bloom luminous green leaves. It typically bears fruit twice a year, with the first harvesting season from January to March, and the second from June to August.</p>\r\n<p>The fruit typically grows in clusters on the branches. It has a characteristic red skin that, when opened, exposes three large, black seeds. Great care is important when harvesting the fruit, because the arils &mdash; the yellow, fleshy portion attached to each seeds &mdash; are the only edible portions. The rest contain toxins that can cause fatal side effects.7</p>\r\n<p>The taste of ackee is often described to be mild, with a buttery and creamy texture.8 Due to these characteristics, ackee is usually treated as a vegetable in cooking, as opposed to a fruit. This is why it is used in many savory dishes, because it can pair well with other vegetables, meat and fish.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Take Advantage of These Health Benefits of Ackee</h2>\r\n<p>Ackee is not just popular for its taste and usefulness in culinary creations. It has potential health benefits that may help with the following:10</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Digestive Problems</p>\r\n<p>The ackee fruit is rich in fiber, which can help regulate bowel elimination by adding bulk to your stool and quickening movement through your intestines. Fiber can also help lower your risk of bloating, cramping, constipation and inflammation of the colon. It may also help reduce bad cholesterol levels, thereby helping boost heart health.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Blood Pressure</p>\r\n<p>Ackee is rich in potassium, which is a known vasodilator. It works by opening up (dilating) your blood vessels so that your cardiovascular system will not work too hard. This can help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and damage to your blood vessels.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Blood Circulation</p>\r\n<p>Aside from helping lowering blood pressure, ackee can help improve your blood circulation. It is rich in iron, which is crucial because it helps deliver oxygen efficiently around your body. The iron content may help with the symptoms of anemia as well, such as weakness, lightheadedness and cognitive issues.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Immune System</p>\r\n<p>Aside from cooking, one of the original uses of ackee is to help alleviate common illnesses. It happens to be a great source of vitamin C, a nutrient that can help boost your immune system, which helps protect your body from various diseases.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploadimg/2041ca994c.jpg'),
(5, 'Apple', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What are apples good for?</h2>\r\n<p>Apples are a popular lunchbox snack known for their delicious, crunchy, juicy and sweet nature. Although they are often considered distinctly American, they actually originated from the mountains of Kazakhstan from the Malus sieversii tree, the progenitor of the modern apple. Interestingly, you can still find this ancient apple tree growing today.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>European settlers brought apples to America during the 1600s and cultivation was successful right from the start. By the 19th century, apples were found everywhere and came in different forms. In 1905, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) noted that there were around 17,000 apple varieties. In actuality, it was around 14,000 because some names would overlap.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Apple Association, around 100 varieties are grown in the United States today, but these are the most popular among consumers:3</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health benefits of apples</h2>\r\n<p>Apples are high in vitamin C,4 one of the most important nutrients you should regularly attain from your diet. Studies show that vitamin C may help regulate blood pressure5 as well as reduce oxidative stress damage caused by exercise.6&nbsp; Vitamin A, also found in apples, is crucial for the reproductive health of both males and females, as well as the growth of embryos.7 Increasing your intake of vitamin A may also help resist infection by boosting your immune function.8 Additionally, apples contain generous amounts of dietary fiber, which may help inhibit LDL (bad) cholesterol concentration, thereby improving cardiovascular health.9</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Apples are a good source of folate, a nutrient that may help lower the risk of neural tube defects in fetuses.10 Increasing folate during pregnancy may also lower the risk of congenital heart defects in newborn children.11</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Minerals found in apples include iron,&nbsp; phosphorus, calcium and potassium, which are important components in helping regulate blood pressure.12 All of these elements and more demonstrate why apples can legitimately be called a &ldquo;superfood.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Studies done on apple</h2>\r\n<p>One study shows that the flavonoids and nitrates in apples may help protect against cardiovascular disease15 by lowering blood pressure, as well as improving endothelial function to regulate blood flow.16 Flavonoids are one of the most important naturally occurring phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research also indicates a connection between eating apples and the reduced risk of certain cancers, specifically colorectal cancer,17 due to the high flavonoid content that releases antioxidant activity. Flavonoids work against cancer cells by influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell differentiation.18</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Polyphenols found in apples may have benefits as well. The following benefits were observed in mice, which may translate positively to human health:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lowered inflammation19</p>\r\n<p>Improved muscle endurance20</p>\r\n<p>Reduced aspirin-related gut damage21</p>\r\n<p>To get the most out of your apples, make sure you eat the peel.

(6, 'Apricot ', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Apricot Good For?</h2>\r\n<p>Ripe and golden with a luscious flavor and velvety surface &ndash; or a more intense shade when dried &ndash; apricots are closely related to peaches, plums, and nectarines. Grown on deciduous trees, they\'re actually a drupe, with the seed central to the surrounding fruit and each having a fairly uniform size. They\'re sometimes overlooked as a fruit, perhaps because there are so many fruits to choose from in today\'s markets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Already well-known in Greece in 60 BC, apricots were transported to Europe by Greeks who called them &ldquo;golden eggs of the sun.&rdquo; Today, apricots\' primary commercial operations are in the Mediterranean and Middle East, with off-season offerings from South America or New Zealand. In America, the first apricot tree was first shipped to Virginia in 1720, but orchards in the Spanish missions of California circa 1790 showed how such a climate can proliferate this fruit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Apricots can be consumed fresh, and can also be a delicious addition to any kind of salad. Dried apricots seem to be the most desired form, and are often mixed with nuts and other dried fruits for a tasty, nutritious homemade trail mix. The pits have their own corner on the market, principally for their bitter oil.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Apricots</h2>\r\n<p>&gt;In fresh apricots, the highest level of vitamins is provided by vitamin A &ndash; 13% of the daily value in one fruit. This includes several beneficial carotenes, which release powerful antioxidants essential for maintaining your optimal vision, healthy skin and mucous membranes, and for protection against lung and mouth cancers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Apricots also are a good source of vitamin C, known to ward off vision problems, promote healthy skin and mucous membranes, protect against lung and mouth cancers, and provide even more free radical-scavenging activity in your body. Flavonoids such as lutein and beta cryptoxanthins have such a high degree of benefits that they can actually help slow and even prevent age-related debilities and disease. Zeaxanthin, a carotenoid that absorbs into the retina, provides protective UV-filtering functions that may ultimately protect you against macular degeneration.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Studies Done on Apricot</h2>\r\n<p>A study was initiated to investigate the effects of an extract from the Japanese apricot (Prunus mume) against three colon cancer cell lines. Scientists concluded that the extract checked the growth and proliferation of malignant cells, causing them to self-destruct.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the power of fruits and vegetables in reducing the risk of several cancers, especially those containing carotenes, due to their antioxidant capability.

(7, 'Avocado', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are Avocados Good For?</h2>\r\n<p>Their flavor and versatility have contributed to avocados&rsquo; rise in popularity. Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, a historian for a group of Spanish conquistadors traversing South America, first talked about a &ldquo;seed like a peeled chestnut surrounded by a paste &lsquo;similar to butter and of very good taste&rsquo;&rdquo; in his book &ldquo;General History of the Indies&rdquo; that was published in 1526. The seed he referred to is what we now know as avocados.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, these interesting fruits were already used thousands of years ago in Central and South America. Avocados were cultivated by the Caral, Mokaya and Maya peoples of Peru2 and Mexico,3,4 and consumed in the Tehuacan Valley (present day Central Mexico) nearly 10,000 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Avocado-related references were also found on Pacal tombs in Chiapas (also in Mexico), and in Aztec paintings. The Mayan calendar also considered avocado as the name of its 14th month.5</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>R.B. Ord, a judge from Santa Barbara, California, is the reason why avocado is now cultivated in the U.S. He acquired three avocado samplings from Mexico back in 1871 and cared for them in his garden.6</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California is now responsible for producing between 75% to 92% of avocados in the U.S.,7 and the California Avocado Commission highlights that the state has 3,000 growers who cultivate the fruit across 50,000 acres.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to Prepare Avocados</h2>\r\n<p>To enjoy fresh avocados (formerly called \"alligator pear\" in England9), they need to be prepared well. As much as possible, peel the avocados using your hands so the antioxidants in the fruits can be preserved.

Black currant sauce can make a delicious savory sauce for serving with lamb, turkey, or fish.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Native to central and northern Europe and Siberia, and found in Britain for over 500 years, the small shrub bearing this fruit is similar to those bearing translucent, white, and red varieties, but while they\'re sweeter, they offer fewer vitamins and minerals. Chinese and European folk medicine both claim dozens of traditional uses for black currants as a curative.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Growing your own black currant bushes requires a few tricks. First of all, they require winter temperatures as low as zero degrees centigrade. Choose a sunny location and add compost or well-rotted manure to the hole before planting. Make sure you add two to four inches of mulch around the plants as they thrive in cool, moist soil. Pick black currants while they are dry and still firm.

This vitamin has antioxidant properties that stop free radicals (from exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants that cause aging, cancer, heart disease, and inflammation) from damaging cells.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>B-vitamins in black currants such as pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and thiamin (vitamin B1) are called \"essential\" because they\'re necessary from regular source outside the body - a.k.a. eating them - because these vitamins are needed by the body for metabolism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Iron is an important mineral in black currants, providing 20 percent of the daily value along with protection against immunity deficiencies and fatigue by transporting oxygen to cells. Also present are copper, calcium, phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, and potassium for optimal cell, tissue, and organ function in the body. Anthocyanins are one of the compounds that make black currants uniquely powerful in antioxidants. Flavonoids like betacarotene, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin help lower the risk of lung and mouth cancers, protect against neurological diseases, slow the aging process, and fight inflammation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The list of other things black currants help with is a long one.

(31, 'DATES', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are Dates Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>Dates don\'t appear to be particularly special with their oddly wrinkled, brown exterior, but they\'re satisfyingly chewy and flavorful. Undoubtedly a favorite of many, dates are considered a drupe because they contain a single pit or stone at the center.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Date palms, which produce these little beauties, were brought to America\'s Western coast by Spanish missionaries in the late 1700s, while other varieties were brought years later.2 In 1900, W.T. Swingle brought the first Deglet Noor offshoots, which is a variety that remains as one of the most important types of dates today. Medjool dates, which were introduced 27 years later,3 are sometimes called the &ldquo;Cadillac of Dates&rdquo; because of their sweet and meaty texture.4</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Aside from the two varieties mentioned above, dates come in other forms that differ in color and firmness. Some of the types available in farmers markets and food stores include barhi dates, halawy dates and khadrawy dates. 5</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Date palms typically start producing fruits at 3 to 5 years of age, and are considered fully mature upon reaching their 12th year.6 But aside from the commercial cultivation of dates, wild populations of the plant are still thriving, specifically in Oman and Jordan.7</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Popular uses around the world include date jam, chutney, date trail mix, flavorings and roasted whole date seeds.8 The tree\'s terminal buds (hearts of palm) may also be eaten raw or added to salads.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Dates</h1>\r\n<p>When it comes to the number of minerals, vitamins and health-benefiting phytonutrients in dates, suffice it to say there are a lot of them.10 They\'re also easily digested, allowing your body to make full use of their nutritional value.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dietary fiber in dates helps to move waste smoothly through your colon and helps prevent LDL (bad) cholesterol absorption. It may also bind with substances that can decrease biological compounds that cause cancer.12 The iron content in dates, a component of hemoglobin in red blood cells, determines the balance of oxygen in the blood.13 potassium, an electrolyte, helps control your heart rate and blood pressure. B vitamins in dates, such as the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, are absorbed into the retina to maintain optimal light-filtering functions and protect against macular degeneration.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, dates contain vitamins A and K. Vitamin A protects the eyes, maintains healthy skin and mucous membranes, and even protects the lungs and mouth from developing cancer.16 Tannins, which are flavonoids as well as polyphenolic antioxidants, fight infection and inflammation and help prevent excessive bleeding (anti-hemorrhagic).17,18 Vitamin K is a blood coagulant that also helps metabolize your bones.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Copper, magnesium, manganese, zinc, niacin, pantothenic acid and riboflavin are also present in dates and provide their own unique preventive and healing functions.20</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Together, these cofactors help your body metabolize carbohydrates, protein and fats. Eating dates in moderation can contribute many health benefits, such as protecting against damage to cells from free radicals, helping lower the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and the development of colon, prostate, breast, endometrial, lung and pancreatic cancers.</p>', 'uploadimg/d3fdb13669.jpg'),
(32, 'DRAGON FRUIT', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Dragon Fruit Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>The pitaya is one of nature&rsquo;s most unique plants, with a flower like an explosion of flame and a fruit like a pink rosebud. Widely known as dragon fruit, it is indigenous to Central America but is also grown and exported from several Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand and Vietnam.1 The dragon fruit is actually one of several cactus species and, just like its relatives, has a succulent stem that provides a uniquely delicious fruit with moisture in the arid climates where it typically grows.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dragon fruit looks like a soft pineapple with spikes, and can have either pink, red or yellow skin and white or red flesh. The fruit also has overlaid or scale-like leaves, similar to an artichoke,3 and an abundance of small, black edible seeds. Its flavor is mildly sweet, like a blend of kiwifruit and pear, and has a crunchy texture.4</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While the fruit may seem a little strange at first, it\'s easy to prepare. Begin by slicing the dragon fruit lengthwise. Afterward, you can remove the flesh, or slice the fruit further into quarters and peel the leathery skin. Make sure that you only eat the white part containing the seeds, and discard any remaining pink portions, as they tend to be bitter.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Dragon Fruit</h1>\r\n<p>Dragon fruit contains a surprising number of phytonutrients.6 It is also loaded with antioxidants,7 and is home to carotene, protein, vitamin C (said to be near 10 percent of the daily recommended value), polyunsaturated (good) fatty acids and B vitamins that may be needed for carbohydrate metabolism .8,9 In addition, this tropical fruit doesn&rsquo;t contain complex carbohydrates, which may allow vitamin B1 (thiamin) along with other B vitamins in the body to break down food more easily in the body.10</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The dragon fruit is also a source of other nutrients like calcium that may help develop strong bones and teeth, iron that may assist in forming healthy red blood cells, and phosphorus to aid in promoting tissue and cell growth, maintenance and repair.11,12</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A phytochemical called captin is present in dragon fruit too. It is typically used in medicines that may help alleviate heart problems. Other known benefits of dragon fruit include boosting the immune system, promoting quicker recovery from wounds and bruises, and reducing the risk for respiratory problems.13</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Eating dragon fruit may also help the body maintain its normal function by helping eliminate toxic heavy metals14 and improving eyesight.15 Lycopene, responsible for the fruit&rsquo;s red color ,16 has been linked with a lower prostate cancer risk.17 Meanwhile,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>seed extracts from dragon fruit are high in polyunsaturated fats (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids)18 that may help reduce triglyceride levels19 and lower the risk of cardiovascular disorders.20 In some cases, oil derived from the seeds may serve as a mild laxative too.21</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Make sure to consume dragon fruit in moderation because it contains fructose, a type of sugar that may be harmful to your health if consumed in excessive amounts.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Do Studies Show About Dragon Fruit?</h1>\r\n<p>Some studies have already been conducted to determine if dragon fruit plays a role in improving overall health and well-being. One example is a 2011 study from the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, where researchers assessed the relationship between a healthy diet containing fruits and vegetables, lifetime physical activity and oxidative DNA damage linked to prostate cancer .</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The conclusion was that exercise and a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those containing lycopene like dragon fruit, were found to be protective against the disease.22</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another study published in Drug Metabolism and Disposition in 2004 aimed to learn more about the capacities of tropical fruits like dragon fruit, since there is limited information surrounding them. The study yielded positive results, and the researchers discovered that tropical fruits like dragon fruit may inhibit the activity of the human cytochrome P450.23</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This substance can often be seen in the liver, but may also be found in other tissues such as in the small intestine, lungs and kidneys, and mutations of this particular substance have been associated with development of congenital glaucoma.</p>', 'uploadimg/8b55bc6f68.jpg'),
(33, 'GRAPE FRUITES', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Grapefruit Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>If you\'re looking for a refreshing, juicy and tart burst of flavor, grapefruits certainly deliver. While they are large in comparison to other citrus fruits like the sweet orange,1 grapefruits are sometimes described as having a &ldquo;bitter and sour punch&rdquo;2, which is why not everyone is a fan of its flavor. However, if you choose the right variety, you&rsquo;ll be taken it by its citrusy sweetness.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Grapefruits can be consumed by themselves or added to any type of fruit or green salad. They\'re also a unique and delicious addition to salsa.3 These fruits have a smooth skin with fine dots all over it,4 but it\'s the color of the flesh inside that determines its classification as a white (blonde), pink or red grapefruit. Another variety is &ldquo;oro blanco,&rdquo; a cross between a white grapefruit and pomelo, described to be sweet with no hint of bitterness.5</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Possibly a cross between an orange and a pomelo,6 grapefruits were discovered in Barbados and exported from that region a century later.7 They reached Florida in 1823, where they were widely cultivated. The state still produces the majority of the U.S. crop, with help from other subtropical states like California, Arizona and Texas.8 Brazil, China, Mexico and the U.S. are the major world suppliers of grapefruit and other citrus fruits.9</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some grapefruit varieties are puckeringly sour and bitter, and others succulently sweet. Some grapefruits are seedless, like the Marsh variety,10 but most contain a handful of white seeds.11 Heavier fruits often indicate thinner skin and juicier flesh. If they appear to have brown heavy bumps, they may be old, meaning the flesh can be bitter and unappetizing.12</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ripe grapefruits should be firm and give a bit when pressed, but not too spongy. Having soft spots indicates they&rsquo;re on their way to turning rotten. Once they reach your kitchen, keep them at room temperature if they\'ll be eaten within 10 days.13 If you&rsquo;ve peeled them and have leftovers, keep them refrigerated in plastic wrap &mdash; they should be consumed in the next three to four days.14 Before peeling a fresh grapefruit, always wash it thoroughly, as any germs on the outside can and will reach the edible part of the fruit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can section and eat grapefruits as you would an orange, but one popular way involves slicing them in half around the middle, using a paring knife to cut each section between the membranes, and removing with a spoon. This takes a minute, but it\'s worth it!15 The riper the grapefruit, the better the taste &mdash; and the antioxidant power it offers.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Grapefruit</h1>\r\n<p>Grapefruits contain an incredibly healthy amount of vitamins, namely vitamins A and C.16 They are also a good source of dietary fiber,17 which decreases the transit time of waste in the colon.18</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A wide assortment of other vitamins and minerals are part of this fruit\'s makeup, but one of the most vital is potassium,19 which is important for the makeup of cell and body fluids20,21 and in controlling the heart rate and blood pressure.22 Grapefruits contain folate, thiamin, vitamin B6, calcium and magnesium,23 as well as lesser amounts of many more phytonutrients like narirutin, naringin and poncirin.24</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin C, of course, is associated with increased immunity to infection,25 as well as potential in alleviating inflammation,26 even in conditions like asthma,27 osteoarthritis28 and rheumatoid arthritis.29 Of all fruit juices, grape juice is ranked among the highest in antioxidants, but grapefruit juice follows closely behind it.30</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Health experts advise including an assortment of fruit juices in your repertoire to achieve the optimum array of antioxidant power. Make sure you always choose 100% pure fruit juice &mdash; otherwise, you\'ll most likely be ingesting unwanted high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In terms of differences between grapefruit varieties, red grapefruit contains more flavonoids and anthocyanins, while the nutritional difference between white and pink grapefruit is that the rosy flush reflects lycopene content not seen in white varieties.31 This is the same compound that provides the color in tomatoes, apricots, papaya and watermelon.32 Lycopene lowers triglycerides,33 contains the highest capacity among all the carotenoids to help fight free radical damage,34 and protects the skin from UV rays.35</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s a dramatic statistic: A research study comparing men who ate lycopene-rich foods the most with those who ate the least, showed that those who eat these foods are 82% less likely to develop prostate cancer.36</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another study shows that eating grapefruit may lower the risk of developing kidney stones.37 Limonin, another phytonutrient, suppresses cancerous cell and tumor growth.38 The pectin in grapefruits inhibits hardening of the arteries and lowers the LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol, reducing it dramatically in a matter of days, even in low amounts.39 The flavonoid naringenin inhibits the hepatitis C virus, repairs DNA in prostate cancer cells and may prevent dyslipidemia (high blood cholesterol) and diabetes.40</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Despite these benefits, be sure that you only consume grapefruit in moderation, as they contain fructose, which may be harmful to your health in excessive amounts.

(5, 'Green-Bean', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are Green Beans Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>A favorite pastime of the summer season is sitting on a porch swing while snapping green beans for dinner. Picking them from the garden is fun, too, whether they&rsquo;re pole beans, which require a stake for support, or bush beans, which don\'t.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But what are green beans, exactly? These are unripe fruits of different varieties of the Phaseolus vulgaris plant.2 The beans usually grow 8 to 20 centimeters long, with green, yellow, black or purple shades.3 Some examples of bean varieties are fava, black, lima, pinto and red kidney.4</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green beans are believed to have Mesoamerican origins, with the wild bean supposedly diversifying in South or Central America.5 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, China, Myanmar and India are the top three producers of green beans as of 2017, with 91.9% of the world&rsquo;s production coming from Asia.6</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, green beans contain one of the highest pesticide contents across the board. Consumer Reports claim that eating one serving of conventionally grown green beans may be 200 times more unsafe than eating broccoli.7 This means that if you&rsquo;re planning on adding this food to your diet, make sure you only purchase organic produce to minimize your exposure to these harmful chemicals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To obtain the maximum nutrients from green beans, the George Mateljan Foundation recommends quick steaming, which consists of steaming the green beans with 2 inches of water for about seven minutes. This limits the green beans&rsquo; exposure to high temperatures, preserving heat-sensitive vitamins, such as vitamin C and vitamin B6.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Green Beans</h1>\r\n<p>If you\'re looking for a vegetable with stellar amounts of antioxidants and flavonoids, green beans certainly fit the bill. Beans have abundant levels of flavanols, such as catechin, epicathechin and epigallocatechin.9 According to a 2009 study from the International Journal of Obesity, catechins, together with caffeine, help regulate body weight by controlling the storage of fat.10 The epicatechin content also offers benefits for people with diabetes by helping reduce blood glucose levels, thereby promoting better insulin sensitivity.11</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green beans are a great source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which play important roles in preserving eye health. These carotenoids may help fight macular degeneration, age-related cataracts, cognition diseases and retinopathy.12,13</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green beans contain considerable amounts of folate (vitamin B9) and other B-vitamins. Folate is well-known for its importance in fetal development and the production of red blood cells. Optimized levels of folate may significantly decrease the risk of neural tube defects in unborn children as well.14</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Despite these incredible benefits, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to note that raw green beans contain small amounts of lectins, compounds that serve as a defense system of plants. When consumed in high amounts, lectins may cause numerous disorders, such as problems with gut permeability and the microbiome. To protect yourself from these possibly harmful conditions, be sure to only consume green beans in moderate amounts.

(7, 'GREEN-PEAS', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Are Green Peas Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>Green peas belong to the legume plant family, Fabaceae, the same as peanuts and beans. Originating from the Himalayan plains of northwest India,1 this variety is said to be related to the field pea native to Southwest Asia and the Middle East.2 Because its cultivation dates back thousands of years, green peas are recognized as one of the first cultivated food crops.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some scientists say this legume may have been dried for centuries before cultivation techniques changed in Europe, right around the 16th century, and it was discovered that they could be consumed fresh.4</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green peas are now grown throughout the world in nearly every climate and time zone,5 and can be purchased either fresh or dried.6 Currently the largest world producer and green pea exporter,7 Canada, grows an average of 3 million tons every year (its production in 2018 was 3.8 million tons),8 with France, China, Russia and India also acting as large producers.9</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions,10 green peas are considered an early spring crop in the U.S. that can withstand light frost and can be planted early.11 They grow on long, curling vines12 that require poles or fences for support.13 For the best flavor and texture, the 2- to 3-inch-long crescent-shaped green pods these vines produce should be harvested before the little round peas inside become too large and lumpy.14</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Snow peas and sweet peas are similar to green peas in description and popularity, having the scientific designation Pisum sativum var. macrocarpon and are probably native to Eurasia.15 Unlike the rounded green pea pods, snow peas are flat.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Green Peas</h1>\r\n<p>Green peas are low in calories in comparison with beans, another legume. They contain healthy amounts of fiber, which helps clean the digestive system. They&rsquo;re also rich in B-vitamins,21 including folate, which is required for DNA synthesis in the cell,22 and plays an important part in the prevention of neural tube defects in newborns.23</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, vitamin C, a water-soluble, free radical-neutralizing antioxidant, is found in peas (40 milligrams per 100-gram serving) and is well-known for fighting infection, protecting against colds and flu, and building up resistance to disease.24</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green peas are a rich source of many minerals such as calcium, iron, copper, zinc and manganese.25 They have 36 micrograms of vitamin K, important for blood coagulation.26 The phytosterol &szlig;-sitosterol content27 has the ability to help lower cholesterol levels.28</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the flavonoid category, green peas provide the carotenoids and the antioxidants catechin and epicatechin.29 Also present are phenolic acids, such as ferulic and caffeic acid, and polyphenols like coumestrol. Pisumsaponins I and II and pisomosides A and B (hence the scientific name pisum) are anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found almost exclusively in peas, helpful against Type 2 diabetes and regulating blood sugar levels.30</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One drawback of eating green peas is that, just like other legumes, they contain plant proteins called lectins, which can be damaging to your health in large amounts. Most lectins are pro-inflammatory, meaning they trigger inflammation and create advanced glycation end products in your body. If you experience symptoms like digestive distress when eating green peas and other legumes, you may want to minimize or avoid these foods, or to make sure they&rsquo;re cooked properly.

Some of the most common types of lentils include black, green and the red varieties. Black lentils, also known as beluga, are famous for their similarity to caviar. They are often cooked in both cold and warm salads. Green lentils are the most widely available variety of lentils and are one of the easiest legumes to cook. They are often added to side dishes and soups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, red lentils, which can actually be red, yellow or gold, are widely used in Indian cuisine. It&rsquo;s the main ingredient in dal, an Indian stew that is often served with rice.

Studies suggest that eating high-fiber foods helps decrease the risk for heart disease, while magnesium helps regulate blood circulation.4</p>\r\n<p>Slows the rate of digestion and sugar absorption. The high fiber content of lentils help slow down the rate of digestion. This leads to the slower absorption of glucose, helping regulate blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n<p>May help in the prevention of birth defects in pregnant women. Lentils contain high amounts of folate, a mineral necessary for preventing neural tube defects in unborn babies. Insufficient folate intake often cause spinal cord defects and may even lead to brain development problems.5</p>\r\n<p>Aids in weight loss. Lentils are low in calories, filling and nutrient-dense. This means that one serving of lentils usually prolongs the period before hunger sets in again, limiting or decreasing the calories that you take in throughout the day.</p>', 'uploadimg/d948f125c7.jpg');

(2, 'Basil', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Basil Good For?</h2>\r\n<p>If a kitchen has only a few herbs in its possession, basil will likely be one of them. Its fragrant essence combines well with rosemary and thyme in meat dishes, fish, vegetables, cheese, soup and eggs, and is one of the main ingredients in pesto, along with pine nuts and parmesan cheese.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although more than 60 varieties of basil have been identified, they all fall into three main types: sweet, purple, and bush. Each offers a subtle difference in taste; varieties such as lemon, anise, and cinnamon basil give you an idea of how one might modify and enhance a recipe. It only takes a few leaves to transform a simple dish - even a sandwich.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basil plants are easy to maintain indoors and out. Snip off budding heads whenever they appear and underneath the base of a leaf near the bottom on spindly stems to keep your plant full, and a new branch will appear.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To dry basil leaves, warm your oven to 140 degrees while placing a single layer of basil leaves on a baking sheet. Turn off the oven and pop in your pan for 20 minutes (you don\'t want them to actually bake). Remove the pan, cool the leaves, and store immediately in airtight bottles or zip-lock bags, away from sunlight.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Basil</h4>\r\n<p>Basil also is considered one of the healthiest herbs. It\'s best when fresh, exuding a sweet, earthy aroma that indicates not only the promise of pleasantly pungent flavor, but an impressive list of nutrients. Vitamin K, essential for blood clotting, is one of them. Just two tablespoons of basil provides 29 percent of the daily recommended value.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basil also provides vitamin A, which contains beta-carotenes, powerful antioxidants that protect the cells lining a number of numerous body structures, including the blood vessels, from free radical damage. This helps prevent cholesterol in blood from oxidizing, helping to prevent atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and stroke.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other vitamins and minerals in basil include iron, calcium, manganese, magnesium, vitamin C and potassium. Not surprisingly, basil also has antibacterial properties and contains DNA-protecting flavonoids. It\'s the flavonoids and volatile oils in basil that give it the most health benefits, the former protecting on the cellular level, with antibacterial properties related to its volatile oils. Among these are estragole, linalool, cineole, eugenol, sabinene, myrcene, and limonene, all capable of restricting the growth of numerous harmful bacteria, including listeria, staphylococcus, E. coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some antibiotic medications that have been found to be resistant to some of these strains have been inhibited by basil extracts. One of those oils - eugenol - can block the activity of the harmful enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).

(7, 'COCOA', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Cacao Good For?</h1>\r\n<p>One of the most wildly popular trees on the planet is the cacao, the plant species from which cocoa &ndash; and chocolate &ndash; is derived. While some might think cacao and cocoa are one in the same, they\'re not, exactly. Cacao is the tree, while cocoa is the product made from it (not to be confused with coca, an evergreen shrub from which cocaine is concocted). Edible parts of cacao pods and the beans inside them can be processed to make cocoa powder, cocoa butter, or chocolate after being dried and fermented.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Because cocoa beans were prized for their medicinal and aphrodisiacal properties, they were traded just like currency among ancient South American civilizations. Rumor has it Casanova was fond of them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The earliest known evidence that cacao was processed for ingestion goes back as far as 1,400 B.C.E., gathered from discoveries of its residue on pottery excavated in Honduras, possibly to ferment the pulp for making an adult beverage. Sweetened forms came about when the Europeans landed in the New World and tasted cacao in liquid form. Although they hated it at first, someone discovered that adding honey made it downright palatable. By the 17th century, this form of chocolate was all the rage in Europe, and subsequently, the world. It still is.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Cacao</h1>\r\n<p>There\'s been a lot of discussion about free radicals and antioxidants, but some are unsure of what these terms mean in regard to our health. Exposure to the sun, cigarette smoke, pollution, and toxic chemicals, such as chemical weed killers, and unhealthy foods can all release free radical activity in the body, however they also can be produced by factors like stress, damaging healthy tissue. Antioxidants in the foods you eat reverse that process, helping to combat disease by zapping harmful free radicals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That\'s where cacao comes in. Raw cacao powder contains more than 300 different chemical compounds and nearly four times the antioxidant power of your average dark chocolate - more than 20 times than that of blueberries. Protein, calcium, carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, magnesium, sulfur, flavonoids, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids are also present. The precise blend of all these elements combined serve to kick in naturally occurring phytochemicals that have incredible benefits throughout the body, such as lowered LDL cholesterol, improved heart function, and reduced cancer risk.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phenethylamine, or PEA, is one of them. Large doses of this compound are said to be released into the brain when we\'re attracted to someone, but natural pain- and stress-relieving chemicals known as neurotransmitters stimulate the secretion of endorphins to help us stay alert and focused.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that chocolate affects your emotions and mood by raising serotonin levels, which explains why chocolate is often craved when gloominess looms. Also to the rescue is a neurotransmitter called theobromine, a mild stimulant sometimes used as a treatment for depression. It releases the compound anandamide, which produces uniquely euphoric feelings of relaxation and contentment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who think chocolate must be bad for you (it has to be if it tastes so good, right?), rest assured: there\'s only one gram of sugar in a half-cup serving of raw cacao. It\'s what\'s done with it that makes the difference. Unfortunately, high heat from processing and refining to produce different types of cocoa or chocolate damages the cocoa bean\'s micronutrients, along with the health benefits.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not only that, but additions like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils limit the amount of actual cocoa, and dairy products actually block the absorption of antioxidants, so if it\'s nutritive benefits you\'re looking for, your average chocolate bar isn\'t likely to supply much.</p>', 'uploadimg/b1477a2679.jpg'),

Read on to learn more about coffee beans, their different types, health benefits and the proper ways to roast them at home.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is a Coffee Bean?</h1>\r\n<p>A coffee &ldquo;bean&rdquo; is actually the seed of a cherry-like fruit that grows on a genus of plant known as Coffea. There are approximately 25 to 100 species of coffee plant under this genus, some of which grow as small shrubs while others grow as tall as trees. The most important species of coffee plant that are cultivated for drinking are the Arabica and Robusta.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It usually takes three to four years before coffee plants bear fruit. Once the fruit&rsquo;s color is a deep shade of red, they&rsquo;re harvested and processed in order to obtain the seeds inside. The coffee beans are then hulled, polished, graded and sorted before being exported.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The milled coffee beans are called &ldquo;green beans.&rdquo; They can be brewed to make green coffee, which is believed to have weight loss properties due to its chlorogenic acid content.4 Green coffee beans can also be slightly roasted to make &ldquo;white&rdquo; coffee beans (which are actually tan in color).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>White coffee beans are considered specialty items and are not widely available. They have a nutty taste when brewed, and are usually mixed with other ingredients to make a gourmet drink.5 Other levels of coffee bean roast include:6,7</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Light roasts: Lightly roasted coffee beans give off a delicate flavor when brewed. They&rsquo;re more acidic than other types of roasts. Their surface also looks dry, since they haven&rsquo;t been roasted long enough to extract their oils. This degree of roasting is commonly used for high-quality beans to make their original taste more noticeable than the roasted flavor.</p>\r\n<p>Medium roasts: Usually referred to as &ldquo;American roast,&rdquo; medium-roasted coffee beans are medium-brown in color, with a slightly toastier flavor and less acidity than lightly roasted beans. Most people prefer this type because of its balanced flavor and acidity.</p>\r\n<p>Dark roasts: Dark-roasted coffee beans are characterized by their very low acidity, shiny black surface and strong, smoky taste. Low-quality beans are often used for this type of roast in order to overpower their original taste with a toasty flavor.</p>', 'uploadimg/fcceefa99e.jpg');

(4, 'Acorn Squash', '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Acorn Squash Good For</h2>\r\n<p>The squash (Cucurbita) genus is a diverse family of vegetables that are used for human and livestock consumption. Depending on the species, they can grow anywhere from 18 to 30 inches in length and come in a variety of shapes. The surfaces may be smooth, ridged or scalloped as well.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with (and have eaten) squashes such as zucchini and pumpkin before. But there are more varieties out there that must be explored and recognized. One such example is acorn squash, which offers a different flavor than other squashes, but is just as healthy.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Acorn Squash?</h2>\r\n<p>Acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo var. turbinata) is a plant native to the Americas. Historians believe that acorn squash was first cultivated by the Native Americans, making it part of the &ldquo;Three Sisters,&rdquo; which are the three most important crops (which include beans and corn) in their culture.2</p>\r\n<p>One of the most distinguished features of acorn squash is its appearance. It has a dark green skin, but there may be harvests that have blotches of green and orange. The name is derived from the fact that the shape looks like an acorn.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How to Cook and Prepare Acorn Squash</h2>\r\n<p>efore you are able to cook acorn squash, you will need to know how to prepare it. To begin cutting an acorn squash, you will need to use a chef&rsquo;s knife or another heavy-duty knife with some weight.15</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start slicing on one side of the stem while cutting straight through the squash. Continue this motion all the way down until you don&rsquo;t encounter resistance and you&rsquo;ve reached the hollow portion. Afterward, pull apart the squash with your hands. From there, you can prepare the squash as you see fit.16</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While baking acorn squash is one of the most popular ways to prepare it, there are other culinary options, as long as you have the imagination. Some ideas you can try include:17</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Soup: Chop up the flesh of acorn squash to create a broth, or puree it for a creamy texture.</p>\r\n<p>Casserole: Place acorn squash into a lasagna, or add it into your favorite casserole recipe.</p>\r\n<p>Salad: Mix chunks of acorn squash flesh with your salads to create new flavors.</p>\r\n<p>Another reason to cook acorn squash is because of its high lectin content. Lectins are sugar-binding plant proteins that attach to cell membranes, which can negatively affect your health, such as causing leaky gut syndrome. Cooking acorn squash properly lowers the amount of lectins in squash and reduces its health risks, while simultaneously helping you gain the nutrients that may actually promote better well-being.</p>', 'uploadimg/8b27479255.jpg'),

Another contributor to its popularity was Catherine de Medici, who took artichokes to France when she arrived from Florence to marry Henry II.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Today, California provides virtually all of the artichokes in the U.S. The California Artichoke Advisory Board notes that it is a minor crop compared to wheat and rice, but still contributes more than $50 million to the economy.4 If left to grow wild, artichokes blossom into large purple flowers.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health Benefits of Artichoke</h2>\r\n<p>The great thing about the artichoke is that it can grow practically anywhere, but the best locations are those with mild winters and cool summers.18 Furthermore, your garden should have full sun exposure and well-draining soil. Plenty of water is also key to growing high-quality artichokes.19</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are three ways to plant artichokes: seeds, roots or shoots. Beginners are generally recommended to employ the root method. Dig the artichokes deep into the soil and place a shovel of compost over them. Space them properly 3 to 5 feet apart since they will be taking up lots of space once they grow. Keep the soil mulched to conserve moisture.20</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You may use organic mulch such as grass clippings, straw, aged manure or a mixture of all three to increase harvest quality.

They also contain potassium, which is necessary for building muscle and regulating the heart&rsquo;s electrical activity, and manganese, which helps maintain muscle and nerve function, build bone strength, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote a healthy immune system.</p>', 'uploadimg/4027301033.jpg'),
(11, 'BELL-PEPPER', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What are bell peppers good for?</h1>\r\n<p>What are bell peppers good for?&lt;/h2&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Bell peppers are some of the most versatile vegetables available, no matter where you go in the world. They make a delicious saut&eacute; with onions,1 and may be added to salads,2 soups3 and casseroles.4 They can be stuffed,5 lightly grilled,6 added to a simple and delicious dip7 or simply sliced for a fresh, flavorful and crunchy snack.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Compared to other peppers, bell peppers aren&rsquo;t known for a high level of spiciness. Red bell peppers tend to be sweeter, as are some yellow and orange varieties.8</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The heat intensity of peppers is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU). Green, yellow or red bell peppers score a zero on the scale, jalape&ntilde;o peppers have around 3,500 to 8,000 and haba&ntilde;eros are at 150,000 to 300,000 units. There are also other peppers you can include in your dishes for both flavor and color, such as banana, shishito, cayenne, and serrano.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Health benefits of bell peppers</h1>\r\n<p>&gt;Bell peppers have a fair share of health-boosting vitamins and minerals. Regular consumption of vitamin C-rich foods, like bell peppers (which may contain more than twice the vitamin C of an orange10) may help protect your body against scurvy,11 boost the immune system,12 decrease inflammation,13 reduce risk for heart disease14 and scavenge harmful free radicals in the body.15</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other nutritional benefits of bell peppers come from nutrients like thiamin (vitamin B1), niacin (vitamin B3), folate, magnesium and potassium.16</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A 2005 study published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis showed that vitamin K, which is abundant in bell peppers, may help synthesize some proteins that may positively affect blood coagulation.17 Vitamin K may also play a role in protecting your bones against osteoporosis.18,19 People with reduced bone density have lower levels of this nutrient.20&nbsp; Interestingly enough, saut&eacute;ed peppers contain higher amounts of vitamin K than raw peppers.21</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While bell peppers&rsquo; health benefits are numerous, it&rsquo;s important to note that they&rsquo;re part of the nightshade plant family22 along with eggplants and potatoes,23 and contain high amounts of lectins. These are plant proteins that can attach to cell membranes.24</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lectins are antinutrients that can resist digestion, cause negative shifts in the balance of your gut bacteria, trigger inflammation, increase your risk for abnormal clotting and potentially predispose you to leptin resistance. However, you can reduce the lectin content in bell peppers by removing their seeds prior to cooking, since these antinutrients tend to be concentrated in the seeds or skin of fruits and vegetables.</p>', 'uploadimg/0d04776255.jpg'),
(12, 'BITTER-MELON', '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bitter Melon Benefits You Should Know About</h1>\r\n<p>Bitter melon boasts a variety of essential vitamins and minerals needed for the smooth function of the body.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But aside from these healthful components, bitter melon contains active compounds that may help combat or even improve some of the most common chronic diseases today. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about it.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Bitter Melon?</h1>\r\n<p>The easiest way to identify a bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is through its rough and wrinkled skin, which some might even call &ldquo;warty.&rdquo;2 But while the fruit might appear off-putting, bitter melon is actually famous for its effects on obesity and diabetes.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bitter melon, also called bitter gourd or Indian bitter melon, is a climbing shrub that typically grows in countries with a tropical climate. The bitter melon plant is a relatively fast-growing plant characterized by its thin stems, tendrils and bright yellow flowers that only bloom for a day.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bitter melon fruits usually start off with a light green shade and become yellow or orange as they ripen.4 Native to India and other countries with warmer climates, bitter melon fruits are usually prepared in dishes, while the leaves are used in teas and soups. But aside from its culinary uses, bitter melon is also used as a traditional medicine in China, India and South America, specifically for tumors, asthma, skin and digestive problems.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the most well-known uses for bitter melon is for the management of diabetes, as the fruit contains three different components that help in blood sugar regulation, namely charantin, peptides and alkaloids.</p>', 'uploadimg/acdc3e67b4.jpg');
